I'm pretty new to the whole meatless dining experience so the first time I went here I was expecting tepid tofu and limp lifeless legumes. Boy was I wrong, everything here just tastes so great- seitan, soy whatever it is that masquerades as meat it is really tasty. The waiters are really helpful and efficient, the diner is brightly lit with natural light that streams in from the large windows and leafy plants add the decoration. Grab a booth if you get a chance, they look like church pews and are hard to enter and exit from but provide surprising comfort and intimacy. As a reformed carnivore I can honestly say that the Diner is my favourite restaurant and encourage anyone to give it a try!\",\n",

Everyone else got the burgers which were just as good.  Nice portions!!! Beer of choice for me: Workingman Mild...excellent! Definitely a nice place for casual eats and good beer.

       "  \"Almost three months after we came here to celebrate our anniversary, I still think Alinea was our most unique food experience ever...even if I can't remember the majority of the dishes. We ambitiously made a reservation for what we thought was 20 courses and when it turned out to be 25, we thought, okay, we can do that. Big mistake. By 18 or so, I felt like I was about to burst and I was really glad I wasn't wearing a tight dress. We had to ask if they could just skip a few for us, and they were nice enough to let us choose from the remaining courses. Note to self: even tiny plates can add up! What impressed us most about Alinea was the service. We went through maybe 21 or 22 courses and with each arrival, our table was cleaned, new utensils arrived on a cushion or tiny platter, and we were told a story about each of our wine pairings. Our servers and sommeliers really knew what they were talking about and no one made us feel like we shouldn't be there (which has happened before seeing as we look fairly young). I have never been so spoiled at a restaurant. We also discovered a delicious muscat that we regret not buying then because we haven't been able to find it since. The quality of the food was impressive and each course was so meticulously plated that for the first few courses we were both gingerly stabbing at our plate, trying not to ruin anything. That night was also the second time in my life where my food came with instructions! For example, one of our courses required sliding a slab of meat off a pin and dropping it into a bowl of sauce before mixing it up and eating it. There was also one where you had to drop a ball into a tiny glass and let the liquid react before drinking it. And there was one mini treasure hunt for the pork inside a tall bowl full of pine needles (that one smelled really good and tasted even better). Of course, the nutmeg pillow had to be my favorite looking as it was pretty cool to watch your plate slowly drop to the table as the pillow deflated. If you like experimental dishes, you'll love Alinea. We're both glad we were able to experience pins and cushions and foam galore, but in terms of taste, some of the flavor combinations just didn't work for us.\",\n",

I arrived at the door on Poetry Slam ngiht with my writer professor friend from Cleveland, editor of a national magazine. Myself, a professor too and software entrepreneur, two Masters, musician, newspaper editor, author and poet -- listed in Poets&Writers Directory. So we're not slouches, and upstanding.Yet upon walking off the street out of the light into the Green Mill entrance area, we were met by a bullying bald bouncer in biker wear. When he wouldn't stop loudly accosting my unassuming friend for being too loud -- I think we said finally here to each other when we walked in -- I politely stated that he was the loud one, not us. Then he kept pressing, pushing obnoxiousness. Threatening us! We couldn't understand what was going on. Then some old lady slurping a drink at the bar chimed in, You're out of here. Leave. In retrospect, I often wonder if she was the owner, or just some slobby drunk. We left, went to Kingston Mines and then Buddy Guy's -- had a great time. Laughing about our experience at the Green Mill. Wondering if the owners knew how maniacal the door-tender is. How he chases away customers. And that witch. The image will never leave our minds. I had been to Green Mill many times, especially back in the 80s, even reading my stuff there. That's the only disappointment about being refused entrance to the Green Mill -- we wanted to read our poetry. Oh well, we thought, their loss. Not sure if or when I'll ever return there again. Not sure if that bouncer mentality will greet me or us next time. No, we hadn't been drinking. Yes, we were very professional, as always, and well-behaved. I just hope that type of treatment doesn't greet you if you dare to visit the Green Mill.\",\n",

Great place for kids with a whole wall lined with cereal options for them to pick and choose from. They really seem to love it. Great wine & drink selections. In the wine department I am currently digging the Malbec they are serving...also on my list of favorites there now is their B-52, coffee+Kahlua+baileys=yum!!! If bloody marys are your thing, Glenn's makes a one of a kind bloody mary that is really tasty. For dessert try some pie made by Hoosier Mama Pie Shop! The staff at Glenn's is fun and friendly. I always take good care of them when I'm there because they take such great care of me! I recommend making a reservation for weekends and nights with specials such as Tuesday crab night!

Actually I didn\\'t know what \"this place\" was; what I should say is that I\\'ve been meaning to try \"that place on Argyle with all the hanging ducks\" for years. The last game I worked on as an artist took place in a Hong Kong marketplace; I took photos of this place as reference so I could get the hanging roasted ducks just right. It was my finest moment in the video game industry. Anyways, we finally tried it. Look, here\\'s the deal: They got ducks in the window. Every Yelper seems to say \"Try the duck!\" So I\\'m not going in and asking them to whip up their finest Empress Chicken. The five stars I give it are based on the full Beijing Duck meal. It rocked my world, as well as that of my awesome friend I was eating with. It was enough for four but we decided to splurge. So, yeah, either get the duck or don\\'t whine about your beef and broccoli. The duck: perfectly crisp skin, perfectly succulent meat. Not a hint of gaminess. The duck drumstick from Sun Wah is like the Platonic archetype of a drumstick. All the courses are great - the skin and meat on a bun with veggies, the soup and the fried rice. Just ridiculously good. If you don\\'t call ahead, there is a bit of a wait for the full duck meal, but that\\'s pretty typical. They have to chase the duck around with a cleaver, you see, and the duck has all sorts of clever ways of turning the tables on the furious, thick-skulled chef. No, wait, that was some cartoon I saw once. Our waitress reminded me of a young Jennifer Tilly. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with the current Jennifer Tilly! Stone fox at every stage of her career. She can hold my Texas anytime! I don\\'t even know what that means.',\n",

The size of this $7 'salad' was also a bit humiliating (4 small pieces of garlic toast and a handful of arugula?) The Mixed-Mushroom/Seitan Veggie Burger with Sage Jelly is certainly an interesting concept, but it was almost too crazy with the flavors for any of them to stand out. I can't deny, though, that I love their customized fry flavors (the closest we have to Pommes Frites in this city) -- the truffled fries were quite tasty. Curry fries were pungent, but would've been preferable to see them with curry sauce as opposed to powder.

Salad Bar - The size of the salad bar is much smaller than that at Brazzaz but the quality is superior. The Caesar salad dressing is excellent. Everything we sampled was excellent. Meat - As non pork eaters, there definitely were fewer options for us to eat, but definitely still satisfying and delicious. The bottom sirloin and house specialty were both excellent. The garlic beef and the chicken were extremely flavorful. The rib eye cut is also delicious. We found the filet cut a bit dry but still flavorful. The lamb chops and leg of lamb were also both delicious. Basically we didn't really meet a meat we didn't like here. The one thing we missed out on was the beef ribs that they bring out on a wooden cutting board. We didn't see this cut until after we were already having dessert, but definitely will have to check it out in the future. Sides - The sides here are delicious. Mashed potatoes are flavorful and garnished with cheese and paprika. The fried polenta was a little on the crispy side for me, but still delicious. The bread is out of this world!!! The fried bananas were beautifully caramelized. The nice thing about Fogo is the minute they see your sides are even close to being done, they swoop in and swap them out for a new set. It is much nicer than at other churascarrias where you have to ask for refills on the sides. Service - Service here is top notch... 100% better than the other churascarrias. We were waited on by an attentive but not overbearing or intrusive waiter. The people serving the meat were attentive, remembered that we didn't eat pork, and very accommodating to the cuts of meat we requested. Also at some of the other churascarrias you have to wait a LONG time before the meat guys come back to your table. Here there was a nice balance of being served an array of different meats without being bombarded by too many at once or not having any meat come around at all for long periods of time. Service is good without being pretentious, which is always a plus. Server took a little while to refill my drink so he gave us our dessert on the house, which was ridiculously good. Must try the CHOCOLATE LAVA cake here!!! Delicious. Ambiance - Lots of hustle and bustle where eating is definitely an interactive experience. Was there on a busy Sunday night and definitely preferred it that way so that meat was coming out fresh and hot. If you're a meat lover, definitely give it a go. Don't forget dessert!!!\",\n",

We started with the Asparagus Beef....holy delicious teriyaki sauce! Just give me a bowl of rice and that sauce and I'll be happy! Next we ordered a few rolls: Nama jalapeno:  A large piece of incredibly fresh salmon with fresh jalapenos-so simple, so good. Spicy Sweet Potato Tempura: Umm....who doesn't love sweet potato tempura?!? Po Boy: White fish tempura, unagi, cream cheese, masago, spicy sauce, scallion, avocado, tempura crumb, eel sauce. Huge!

I had a great experience here with my hubby. so much that we were back the next day for more of the same. the burgers are phenom and the room is a must see.  if you like burgers.... don\\'t waste your time going to the \"other place\" go to Lockdown and get the ultra-burger experience.  I really wanted to add more to that review because a review on this place deserves detail. But I had already given the previous review that was mysteriously lost in yelp wasteland heavy detail and then there was no time to rewrite.  Let me underscore.... The burgers here are great!! The mac & cheese I got with my burger was cheesy and full of flavor. I built my own burger with pepper jack cheese, bacon and egg. It was plenty of food. My hubby had the Death Sentence which was a giant 20oz double burger.  Excellent!! It did take a while for our food to come out as our ticket got lost for a while but it was really not a big deal. They were very apologetic and it was worth the wait for definite. The atmosphere here is loud with great metal music and about 10 televisions that lined the walls with videos. The second night we were there Alice n Chains Unplugged was on all of the televisions. Free concert... cant beat that.  I love the way they go for it at Lockdown. They know what they\\'re selling and doing and they do it really well. We will absolutely be returning.',\n",

Food wise, not bad. But when they have the bread and fruit appetizer as the starter, they don't give you an option for anything but a swiss based cheese...which tasted like it was mixed with wine. Not very flavorable. Main course, they use an oil base rather than water (some people don't care, but just something you may want to know when you're soaking all your veggies and meats in oil!). The only reason I didn't give this place a higher rating is because they do not give you options for cheese or chocolate and all that. I'm still happier with Melting Pot.\",\n",

We were not disappointed at all and Sapori lived up to its Yelp-hype.   We were lucky to be seated in the small middle room, which holds just 5 tables, making for a much more quiet, intimate dinner. (Note to mgt: the walls could use some adornment, pictures/frescos/a splash of red sauce).  We started with the avocodo bruschetta. My main avocado experience is only with guac, but this was a winner! Creamy chunks of perfectly ripe avocado topped with thickly grated parmasan, diced provolone, and tomatoes on a toasted baguette.  It is a must-order! We shared entrees: rigatoni with freshly crushed tomatoes, basil, and mozzerella. So simple and yet incredibly delicious and elegant.  The other shared dish were their ribs. If you are expecting bbq or asian style, you will be disappointed, as these fall off the bone babies are more savory than sweet....something you'd expect to find in northern Italy. Needless to say, not an ounce of meat was left on the plate. Tiramisu was excellent, though whoever dusted the top with cocoa powder overdid it quite a bit.  Service was excellent: attentive and knowledgable.  Looking forward to returning and trying the lobster ravioli next time!\",\n",

In spite of the noise and the fact that it is always packed (esp. the Milwaukee St location), the food is almost always top-notch. But I recently did have a bad experience here. The food took over an hour to arrive, even though we were seated about 15 minutes after they opened. In spite of the wait we remained optimistic. Then we got our breakfast: undercooked doughy pancakes, and a (decent) omelet with burned black homefries. Really. Burned black hunk of crust. Totally unacceptable. The cook actually hid them under a thin layer of mushy uncrisp potatoes and I did not see them at first. I was so hungry by this time that I just ate the mushy potatoes along with the omelet. When my waitress FINALLY returned to check on us (not really her fault, she was just slammed), upon seeing the black potatoes, she did apologize and offered me new potatoes, but by then I had eaten the edible portions on my plate (We also barely touched the half-cooked pancakes). I said no thanks to more potatoes, but asked politely for compensation.They gave me $2.50 off of this disaster. whoopie. I think they should have comped the whole bordering-on-terrible meal. I don't take going out to eat lightly, I am very selective about who gets my money, and this just really put me off. I won't be going back again.

The waitress was amazing! I told her what I craved in a world of dark beer and she delivered beyond my expectations... On a side note I went to buy this beer at SAMS and it was $4 or $5 a bottle which means Hopleaf's markup was not all that much-which-blows my mind not only do they have one of the best beer selections in Chicago it is decidedly fairly priced! I had the Duck Reuben and it was just delicious! What more could I ask for? Oh I know!-A spoon or a straw to suck down that amazing dipping sauce for the fries-are you kidding me! That sauce is mind blowing our table clearly almost had a passive fight for that amazing little cup of sauce! It was no weak sauce for sure! I was dining with some discerning out of towners who had just done the Alinea 23 courses of ecstasy the day before... They still found excitement here at my neighborhood Hopleaf, little did I know that this place is known at all corners of the earth... Now I do and understand the wait a little better-darn tourists! Just kidding! I have had more then a few questions as to what beer I was drinking as with many of the beers you will partake in-it was served in a glass specific to its varietal... It is - I copied this from the brewers website... St Bernardus Abt 12 The absolute top quality in the hierarchy of the St. Bernardus beers. It is also the beer with the highest alcohol content (10.50 %). A dark ivory coloured beer with a high fermentation. The show piece of the brewery. Thanks to its soft and unconditionally genuine aroma, the beer can be smoothly tasted. The Abt has a very fruity flavour. Hop Hop Hop To The Hopleaf!\",\n",

I visited this location with a group of five and we were lucky enough to get a table outside on a gorgeous day. If I lived in Chicago, I would find my way here at least once a month. Probably more often that that actually. Everyone in my party liked their lunch/brunch. I ordered a special - which was a quinoa burger with grilled peaches and chipotle sauce on top. Sounds odd right? Well, it was awesome. Also, the bloody mary wasn't too shabby either. Other highlights were the breakfast burrito, the scramble and the sweet potato fries. I can't say anything was bad, except maybe the service seemed a little slow especially since it wasn't very busy for the time we were there. The coolest part? The roof garden where they grown their own vegetables as well as the greenery surrounding the outdoor seating area. I won't lie, I might have stolen a few tomatillos that were ripely hanging off the stalk. Oh, and I stole a mint leaf too to freshen my breath after wards. Maybe stealing isn't the best word - sampled is better. All in all, I really love this place and wish more restaurants would follow suit.\",\n",

The place was paractically empty and we caught this very mellow trio with a torchy singer. Great experience.

       "  \"I have mixed feelings about this place - because our experience was somewhat lacking, yet it really does have a lot going for it. It definitely has 'ambience.' It's charming and intimate, if not just a bit on the cramped side. Parking is good if you park on the side street nearby. They offer a decent selection of pastas, although we were a bit confused with our waiter's explanation of the homemade vs. out of the box choices (and the difference in cost, at least according to him). In fact, our server was the worst part of our dining experience. He was impatient, distracted, and at times, downright rude. At one point, he actually walked away as my husband was still speaking to him. We literally had to ask someone to send him back to our table, which clearly annoyed him. When I asked questions about how certain foods are prepared (since I have several food allergies), his answers were all over the place, and at times, his visible irritation with my (very necessary) questions made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Regarding the food, my entree was okay; nothing special - and somewhat over-priced. My husband ordered some sort of seafood pasta - which he thoroughly enjoyed. Bottom line: I think we would give them another try, but we'll definitely ask to be seated in someone elses section to avoid a repeat performance\",\n",

       "  \"*5 stars for a fast food joint* After hearing about Hot Doug's forever, a friend and I decided to go on a Friday that we had off. As we walked up, there were about 8 guys already in line ~20 minutes before opening. Our wait went by fairly quickly, and we were soon inside...to wait yet again, but this time to order. There's quite a few choices on the menu! What I got: The Cheesy Atomic: Spicy jack cheese, stuffed pork sausage with spicy passion fruit mayo and habanero jack cheese. My favorite - great flavor, and the right amount of heat from the various peppers thrown in the cheese and mayo. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage: with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (fancy salt). I found the foie gras on the duck sausage to be there more for texture than flavor, and the sausage itself was fairly bland. That's to be expected for duck I suppose, given my past experience with duck sausage. I think this would greatly benefit if Doug were to saute the foie gras a bit to warm it up. Norm Crosby: a hot dog with beef, pork, and garlic, served Chicago style. Didn't really notice much of a difference between this and a normal hot dog given all of the condiments thrown on top. Duck Fat Fries: only served on Fridays & Saturdays. Delicious. Spectacular! Some of the best fries I've had. Overall, I'm happy with the food I got at Hot Doug's, and I know my friend is in love with the place and keeps going back any chance he gets. I don't think it was utterly amazing...but it's a fast food place. That said, Hot Doug's is one of the top choices in the city for your favorite fast food/junk food, which is why I give it 5 stars for a fast food joint. I think it's worth a wait - but not the 2+hrs some people have been waiting. If you want to go, get there early on a weekday and (preferably Friday to get your hands on some duck fat fries) and chow down!\",\n",

With short notice, they took our 10:10pm resy without hesitation on a Saturday night. Highly regarded with sister restaurants Avec and Blackbird, this resty is deemed as Pig Capital by many, so I couldn't resist. Their dual pig logo says it all. Communal tables are predominant here, with 'pig pen' seating aka booths with enclosed wooden fence doors along the sides of the walls. Super high ceilings, round light fixtures, an open kitchen, and pig art are noticed upon first glance. Not just pig art, but HUGE pig art. Who's super genius idea was this? The food is that of typical gastro pub fare, with small bites such as Charcuterie plates and oyster platters as well as full fledged entrees. Beer selection is vast and service is next door neighbor friendly. Wait staff wears khaki colored blazers with casual attire underneath. Desserts here are almost an afterthought, with nothing to write home about. Check your pretentiousness at the door. They'll have none of that here. Ordered: -Spicy Pork Rinds ($5) [Slagel Family Farm, Fairbury, Illinois] - tasted like tabasco powder w/ parmesan cheese, tart, addictive, served in large brown paper cone, you get about 20 -Chef's Selection Oysters ($15/6) - not super meaty but fresh, super cold, just the way I like it -Pork Belly ($20) - w/ artichoke hearts, tomatoes, clams in shell, caramelized sweet glaze on one end of it, super melty, simple and hearty, CRACKTACULAR! Total came out to $26/pp after everything Pics: http://www.meetup.com/foâ\\x80¦\",\n",

My husband's family friend learned that we had never had peking duck before, so they made a reservation at Sun Wah immediately to introduce us to this delicious meal. Bear in mind that they live in Hawthorn Woods so it's a bit of a trek for them, but this is THE place in Chicago to get peking duck. We were told that they pre-ordered the peking duck when they made the reservation - I guess the restaurant can run out if you don't pre-order? So the next time we visit, we will make sure to pre-order. The place was packed so we were especially glad that we had secured our 2 ducks beforehand. The ducks are carved tableside and then served with little bao buns/hoisin sauce/veggies/pickled radish so you can make heavenly duck sandwiches. I don't even usually like duck, but this duck is frankly amazing. Then the waiter takes the duck back to the kitchen and out comes soup, rice, and noodles all made with the rest of the duck. Of the three, my husband and I liked the noodles the best because they were the most flavorful. I didn't love the soup and the rice was just so so. But it doesn't matter. You come here for the little amazing do-it-yourself duck sandwiches. And they are definitely amazing!\",\n",

By the time the whole group got there, we were split into separate booths in the same section. Kind of annoying, but no biggie. Everyone else wanted crazy toppings on their pizzas, but all I wanted was a standard margarita pizza (mozzarella, tomato, basil) I was very happy with my personal pizza since the crust was PERFECT! Perfect to the point of growling like a raccoon when my sister tried to swipe a piece. I think the quality of the crust goes down as the size of the pizza increases, so I wouldn't go bigger than a medium. I tried Piece again with a friend, since he's a Wisconsin lovin', vegetable hatin' carnivore we got pepperoni pizza. I was sorely disappointed when the pepperoni greased up the pizza so much that I could barely eat it, in fear of igniting my acid reflux. I'd give this place another chance since it's in a convenient location, the pizza's good when its on the smaller side, and MAKER'S MARK MONDAYS!\",\n",

       "  \"What says Chicago cuisine better than a restaurant that is dedicated to pig? The Purple Pig honors this succulent beast by using all of the parts from the ear, neck, tail, and bones.  This place gets packed fast. We arrived 20 minutes after opening and there was already a 45 minute wait. Luckily for me, we got the best seats in the house - right in front of the preparation area. Many people criticize that the dishes are on the salty side but it's the flavor profile of pork. The portions are small but you can order several dishes while trying different parts of the animal. We went with the pig ears, roasted bone marrow, and parmesan eggplant balls. The pig ears reminded me of a twist on cracklins served with a runny egg and fried greens. Some hot sauce or Tabasco would have finished the dish perfectly. The roasted bone marrow tastes like a gelatinous oil with a roasted flavor. It paired well with the crusty bread, greens, and lemon vinaigrette. The fried eggplant balls were mini bites of traditional eggplant parmesan in tapas form. Not particularly outstanding but a good filler. The Purple Pig brings out true porky goodness with innovation. Mr. Oink does look better in purple.\",\n",

       "  \"A very seen and be seen place with modern, edgy, Asian decor and the usual, yuppie crowd. I'm just happy to have a sushi restaurant in the neighborhood amidst all the pub fare, Italian, seafood, steak and American restaurants.  I was underwhelmed by the dumpling appetizer. The dumplings were served individually in tiny bowls with a drop of broth making me feel like I was having a shot glass of dumpling. Too strange. The $50.00 plate of kobe steak was disappointing because it had quite a bit of grizzle, and after having cut it away, you wondered if that grizzle was $10.00 worth. I loved my spicy tuna, but you have to suppose any sushi restaurant could get that right. I ordered two plates because one plate wasn't filling enough. A glimpse at the dessert menu let me know where the fusion part is. I have a wicked sweet tooth, but the Asian twist on American desserts didn't sound appetizing to me. I can see why the restaurant is popular, but it just ididn't work for me.\",\n",

The servings were elegant and tasteful. I think the one thing that stood out most about all the food was the attention to texture in addition to flavor. There was an aura of authenticity, but also freshness. At the end of the night, the owner played a trick on us with a tube and some amazing brandy - hey, most people aren't just handing out alcohol these days and it made us feel like regulars even though it was our first time there.

I\\'m Italian-American, and I don\\'t usually choose to go to an Italian restaurant when I go out to eat for several reasons: cheap ingredients, high prices for something I could easily make at home, and heavy, tomato-based fare. However, I\\'ve had plenty of delicious dishes at Sabatino\\'s; including a fantastic risotto with shrimp that isn\\'t always on the menu. Their sea food is surprisingly amazing in general. However, I think Sabatino\\'s is worth 3.5 stars, actually. It\\'s nice, family-style, classy and old-fashioned inside. However, the tables are tiny. I sat with my brother and parents at a table recently, and we were putting the bulky wine menu, flowers, candle, etc. on the table next to us temporarily. There was just no room for the fresh baked bread or pizza bread before the meal, and definitely no room for our dinner and sides. The owner is a friendly gent most times, but the last time I was there he decided to blow up and go on a tirade about a party that just arrived to the assistant manager and a waitress in our dining room, on a Sunday afternoon. I know the restaurant business is crazy, but that was unacceptable. I later politely told the assistant manager that we didn\\'t enjoy the shouting match during my parents\\' anniversary meal, to which she replied \"That\\'s my boss for ya!\" and threw her arms up in resignation. Again, the restaurant business is insane; I\\'ve been around family members\\' restaurants in my life to know.

       "  'Oftentimes, after I get the bill at a restaurant, I end up doing the Squinty Bill Scratch, even though I should know better by now. I mean, it\\'s not like the prices magically increase en route from the menu to my tab, right?  (And stop feigning confusion here. The Squinty Bill Scratch is that thing that happens when the bill first arrives at your table & sets off a contagious eye-narrowing head-scratching combo that spreads like wildfire as you try to find the high-priced drink that broke the camel\\'s back.) Anyway, I was all prepared to do the SBS when the bill arrived at Irazu. You see, the bf & I went a little bit crazy with the food ordering, which is easy to do when faced with such a fantastic menu.  First, we each ordered a horchata, which was quite cinnamon-y & delicious. Next, we got the chips & spicy guac, followed by a side of fried yuca with mojo (garlic oil), & a side of fried plantains, also with mojo. (FYI: it\\'s best to get just 1 mojo-based dish, regardless of how much you love garlic.) Finally, I ordered the veggie burrito (which was as scrumptious as it was HUGE), & my bf ordered the pepito sandwich (he was in heaven). However, after enjoying plate after plate of fantastic vittles, it occurred to me that my prior \"dinner\\'s on me tonight\" declaration might have been a mistake. So, I began doing the math in my head, expecting at least a $40 dinner, not including tip. (That\\'s a lot of dough when you\\'ve got a non-paying internship, okay?) Thus, when the bill arrived, I was already mentally prepared to take a hit. Then, something amazing happened: before I could even start the Squinty Bill Scratch, my eyes darted to the bottom of the bill, which clearly contained a mistake. The total was $27.50!  Yep, that\\'s right, TWENTY-SEVEN FIDDY! For all of that food. For garlic & cinnamon breath. For fantastic service. For leftovers, even! I repeat: $27.50!! It was not a mistake. And for that, I am in love with Irazu.',\n",

It was worth every penny not only for the exquisite and unique food, but for the entertainment value. Where else can you go for a meal and never eat off of anything that looks remotely like a plate -- and where every item that is used to hold or contain each morsel of food is something you've never seen before? Where else can you go where you feel like you've died and gone to Heaven after every bite? The word inventive is wholly inadequate to convey how off-the-charts the food is. I spent the entire meal with my jaw on the floor, so to speak, and was utterly depressed when the meal was over and we had to leave. Save your shekels, and then run, do not walk, to Alinea. You will have a meal you will be talking about for the rest of your life. Wishing Grant Achatz good health and happiness for decades and decades to come.\",\n",

So attentive in fact, that my sister, cousin and I play a little game to see how low we can get our water glass before they refill it. Trust me when I say that it is RARE to be able to get your water glass completely empty. That is impressive. But if you want to fully enjoy their buffet, I advise against playing this game. Just take my word for it. I have been here once for dinner where I actually ordered off the menu and I had Chicken Chili Masala. Now, I have always been a fan of Chicken Tikka Masala, as it is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so I thought I would get a little crazy. Oh. My. God. It was so worth it. It was phenomenal. The Chicken Chili Masala was so good that I was raving about it for weeks on end. My mouth still waters at the thought of this dish! This place is totally worth the trip. The quality of the food is out of this world. The balancing of spices, aromas and decor is nothing short of a dream.  Oh, and I ALWAYS take my friends here who have never tried Indian food for the lunch buffet. I feel that when you are introducing people to new flavors, it is good for them to try multiple things to see what they do and don't like... That way *one dish* isn't the determining factor of their decision.\",\n",

       "  'I was very nervous walking in here because previous reviews were either \"I loved it\" or \"not.\" Personally, I liked this place enough to go back and try other things on their menu. Allow me to explain. First, the location for me cannot be matched. As others have said, there\\'s nothing else in this neighborhood that meets what uncommon ground is able to do...it\\'s a cross between \"finer dining\" and \"casual dining\" without being pretentious, which I appreciate. Sometimes, you just want a step up from the usual Thai for $6 dinner and UG was that place today. Our service was wonderful. We were seated promptly in a dining room that was comfortable and friendly. The wine list was amazing...just from the descriptions you could choose to travel to France, Italy, or--as we chose--Napa. The cabernet we picked was wonderful. The server was ready to answer our questions if we had them (which we really didn\\'t.) Our main course was good. I had a pizza which was super crispy thin crust (just like I LOVE...but not oven fired...don\\'t get too excited). Everyone\\'s entrees were good and, given the unique flavor combos and the \"one step up from usual\" ingredients, we were more than satisfied (this, of course, is the dinner menu). Up to this point, my review was wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but let me talk to you about the dessert for one minute. We ordered some cherry-ginger--wonderful cookie confection with \"salty peanut\" gelato and a tasting bowl of 3 kinds of sorbet: caramel and goat cheese, \"salty peanut\" (which was described to us as \"like peanut butter\" but ended up being 10 times more sublime), and cucumber-rose. This dessert just made me happy. The cookie thing wins HANDS DOWN. I was amazed at how well ginger and peanuts pair together but I would pay mucho deniero to have it again. It was wonderful. In the end, the dessert and the wine sold us on this place. I definitely want to go back to try out the other \"menu regulars\" and their other specials looked wonderful. There\\'s more exploration to be done here, but I can definitely say that for a middle-of the-road dining experience in Edgewater, this place totally cuts the mustard. The slightly higher prices are totally worth it. I\\'ll certainly be back...if only for the gelato...but really, isn\\'t that enough?',\n",

After much deliberation, I decided on the Peeky Toe Crab Benedict with One Hour Eggs, Old Bay Infused Hollandaise and the House Potatoes. Holy YUM. This particular dish was almost too indulgent, so I was sad that I could not finish it. At $13, you get more than your money's worth--highly recommend. I would love to come back for their PBR Breakfast, which consists of Two Eggs Any Style, Nueske's Bacon or Housemade Sausage, House Potatoes, and an Ice-cold Can of PBR...all for $7! It seems like quite the deal. After reading all these awesome reviews about their Lunch and Dinner items, I am for sure coming back. See you soon L&E!!! xoxo\",\n",

       "  \"If anyone out there is looking for a justification to the arm and leg paid for a dinner at Alinea, let this be it. Although the cost of one dinner at this place may not be so easily digested, let me assure you it is an experience worth having. To be completely honest, I was nervous about eating at Alinea for the first time. My boyfriend and I decided to prepare for a night of food sin. We did the 25-course meal, the larger of the 2 choices. We were pleasantly surprised, after walking through the spaceship-like entrance, to be seated in a very intimate white room, much resembling the family room in my grandmother's house. The room held about 6 small tables seating 2-4 people. The wait staff was very informative and friendly, humoring us and our lack of knowledge of the wine selection with background information about the vineyards and years of all the wines and even some fun information about special curing of a couple of the wines. The food itself was incredible. Even if you are not blown away by the flavor of each and every course, there is a lot of thought and work going into every dish which is very apparent. There is at least a respect factor involved. Every course started with an in-depth description of the course and instructions on the best way to eat it. I don't want to spoil any of the surprises, but I WILL say the dishes tend to touch on all the senses. It is obvious that all senses have been thoroughly considered in the creation process. The quiet and calm environment, in which there is purposely no background music, was very relaxing and my boyfriend and I were able to fully enjoy each other's company as well as this esculent adventure. I definitely recommend that the foodies and appreciators of food art experience this restaurant at least once in their lifetimes. There are a couple of funny surprises towards the end of the dinner. If my description of the restaurant sounds at all stuffy, let me assure you that it is not. I had a great, fun, unforgettable experience at Alinea. It was what I expected it to be and more. Go for it, it's worth it! I promise.\",\n",

There is a great salad bar where you can select your own food--I really appreciate being able to view the food (especially unfamiliar food) before it's served and also being able to select portion sizes. I always order the spicy falafel sandwich minus the Jerusalem salad (Note: there is nothing wrong with the salad--it's just a preference. You can also swap out the salad with tabouli, if you prefer.). It's just falafel, hummus and a spicy chili sauce in a pita. Delish.

The bone marrow was a new experience for me and I wasn't really digging it just from a pure textural perspective (admittedly, I don't like the concept of chewing on fatty tissue, though the onion jam should be on everything). The oxtail gnocchi was very good but it was more of an enhancement to the scallops (which I didn't care for because I'm not that big of a seafood eater), and the chicken was average.

First, not sure how they could compare the 2, as the style of pizza is like comparing apples to peaches. Yes, they both use an oven heated by fire. That's about it.  Anyways, back to Spacca: Went on a Friday night, just before they really got busy. Yes, per the complaints of some other reviewers, there is a wait until all of your party has arrived, but that is their policy, stated upfront, and I don't see it as a bad policy. I have seen restaurants move tables together for a larger party, only to have some of the extra table space go to waste when part of the party decides not to show up. For a small restaurant on a busy night, this policy is totally in line with an efficient business plan. There was a short wait for our table, but it seemed like every 5 minutes the manager/hostess? or the owner was coming around with a sample of wine, or cheese, or pizza! My only suggestion would be some more space for those waiting, but due to the actual size of the space, not sure that's possible, without losing tables to be seated. I don't know Italian, so I had many questions for our waitress, who answered everything in a friendly manner, and made some great suggestions to our party. Not a huge wine list, but excellent wines that complement the menu items! I recommend any pizza with the authentic Italian sausage. And the mozzarella they use is amazing. That said, this IS NOT Chicago-style pizza! This is authentic, simple Napolitan pizza. The room tended to be a bit noisy, but it is not designed to be a quiet romantic 5 star French restaurant. The way the owner went around to the tables, it was more like a big family dinner with waitstaff! And a handshake from the owner on the way out, thanking us for coming? Very nice! Overall, a great experience, I will definitely be back.\",\n",

Last night my friends and I ate here and experienced several issues: 1) No one took our drink order until we flagged them down and told them we would like to order drinks. 2) After we received our sushi it was 45 minutes until anyone came to our table again. We seriously thought they had forgotten about us. 3) While we were asked if we\\'d like another drink while waiting for our sushi, which was nice, the entire 45 min we waited for someone to come back to our table we weren\\'t offered another drink. And the kicker... My friends and I generally tip 20% everywhere we go. We feel that\\'s standard. In this case we tipped 10% (on the entire bill, including tax and alcohol), which we thought was fair given the quality of our service. Our server immediately came to our table to collect our credit card receipts (so they did know we were there!) and cornered us to ask why we only tipped 10% when they are used to receiving 18-20%. Now, I can see if the server was asking to merely understand what our issues were, but it was obvious she was attempting to pressure us into leaving a better tip. It was uncomfortable. Furthermore, when we explained why we left 10% as opposed to 20% she simply disagreed with us. The conversation ended with her saying \"Well thank you very much\" and walking away while we were still talking. It was surprising, to say the least. I would like to attribute the poor service to an isolated incident, but this was really just the ending of a series of visits to this restaurant where we encountered continually declining service.

I\\'m only judging Opart by one takeout of phad thai which is not a good enough standard to judge by so this judgement is more about the transaction. Otherwise, Thai is my favorite and I try a variety of dishes in Thai places around Chicago, NYC and Seattle (and stayed in Thailand for 3 months up and down the country). When I ordered the takeout of veggie phad thai, the guy said $9.54. I paid that without really thinking. Then while waiting for the food, I looked at the menu and it said phad thai was $6.54. When the food came, the receipt said it was $8.54. So maybe I paid $8.54 and he just mistakenly said $9.54. I had already put the jumble of change in my wallet and didn\\'t look back at how much he gave back to me. I asked why it cost $8.54. He said \"it\\'s $2.00 for extra veggies, we do that for chicken or tofu too\", justifying it. I didn\\'t order extra veggies, I just said veggie phad thai, but I didn\\'t argue about it. When I ate the phad thai, I did not have extra veggies, it was just a standard amount. And the phad thai was okay. I was a little miffed. The menu should really say \"phad thai, $8.54\" NOT $6.54 if they\\'re gonna tack on an extra $2.00 for what should be standard with the dish. But this place was packed with people. Maybe the other dishes are good. I thought Spoon Thai a block down had a great phad thai with no extra hidden charges.',\n",

       "  'What can I say in this review that hasn\\'t already been said. I believe yelp said it best, \"Yay! I\\'m a fan.\" Indeed. We had reservations for 7 and getting there was breeze! Located in the downtown area, of course the environment was absolutely beautiful. We sat down and the word to describe the decor of this place is sleek. Tables with intimate lighting fixtures. This place is doing it right. As you might already know readers, I am Filipino. I enjoy the cooking of my people and I am super judgmental of Filipino restaurants. This one blew me out the water. Who knew Filipino cuisine could be highlighted in such a great way? I did. But now the posh downtown Chicago folks get a chance to taste it. How exciting. We ordered the braised pork belly and the adobo flake fried rice. Yes, adobo flake fried rice. Adobo is a meat (in this case pork) braised in soy sauce and vinegar and the meat is flaked/pulled and thrown into the fried rice. It is so amazing. The rice was cooked perfectly and served in the cast iron pot. The adobo braise pork belly was so tender and juicy. The depth of flavors were so complex yet brought me back to a familiar taste. This is a must try when you go there. We also had the five spice fried chicken and some place over fry the chicken leaving it dry and tasteless. Not Sunda, in their fashion, the of course made is juicy and delicious. The five spices added a bit of a kick but sweet at the same time. The the dishes were presented like they were going to be served to royalty. (you eat with your eyes first). To wash it all down I got some mango iced tea. The iced tea (unsweetened) comes to you in this huge carafe and a little tiny pouring cup on mango syrup (flavor and sweetener) so you can control how sweet or unsweet you want it. Genius! Our server was knowledgeable and attentive even though the place started to become hectic, she kept her cool. So I challenge all you readers to give Filipino food a shot here at Sunda and I am sure you will not be disappointed. If you are disappointed, wrap it up and give me what you didn\\'t like :) Excited to return back to Sunda to try the rest of their expansive menu.',\n",

       "  \"This was the single best, most memorable, eye-opening, and flavorful culinary experience I have ever had. As a teacher, my salary does not allow for frequent dining splurges, but I try I find a way to visit some of the country's best restaurants when I can (Chez Pannise, Fench Laundry, etc.). My visit to Alinea was SO worth the penny pinching needed to go there. So if you are like me and wondering if it is worth the money....DO IT. Also, for so upscale a restaurant the service was friendly and playful, not stuffy at all. We ordered the smaller tasting menu, which did not include the truffle explosion. When I called in advance to see if I could add that dish (indicating I would be happy to pay more) they said it was no problem. Not only did they include the extra dish, they didn't even charge anything extra. I won't go through the long menu dish by dish, I will just say that every one of them was just amazing. Most of the time I was eating, my eyes were closed so I could focus in on the unusual flavors and textures. Not sure my review adds anything to everything else that has been said about Alinea, but I wanted to write a review to emphasize that if a dinner here is a big splurge for you, you won't regret it.\",\n",

Meat was wonderful - plenty of variety.  I'm deducting a star because we couldn't go to the rooftop bar afterwards, unless we'd have gone outside and queued. We were at the top of the stairs when a guy appeared and told us to go outside and queue - he wasn't very polite and just barked that the bar was separate to the restaurant. This should be explained on their website and when you arrive as it spoilt an otherwise perfect evening.  Definitely worth going for the food.\",\n",

The waiter was not interested in us at all, he never made eye contact with us. The salad bar is really great. Do try the basil dressing, its amazing. The meat was very good. I suggest the lamb...I never liked it before, but the chops were great!!! I was impressed, I came back fron the salad bar and went to sit down and a random waiter pushed my chair in for me...never saw him again. Over all the group I brought enjoyed their meal, we had a nice time, the drinks were great...would I go back again? Maybe. Our server was more concerend with pushing drinks than how our dinner was. Kudos to the guys who actually work...the gouchos with the meat.I'm sure it was a bad night, but we are pretty positive the potatos were instant. No one said a thing until the drive home. I thought they tates peticularly bad, but didn't say a word to the other diners because iwas embarassed. But they were instant, and now I'm mortified! We had a $700 tab, and ate instant potatos...shame on us for not saying anything.\",\n",

The waiters were so fuken FRIENDLY, they made me feel really comfortable being here! :) N E ways, i spent many hours trying to look for a fancy to casual mexican restaurant, and i chose the mayan mexican cuisine. Why i chose it? I liked their website! But dont judge a website by its cover, : | The restaurant was small and pretty calm. I was not WoWEd about their food though, it was allright but maybe cuz i was STARVING! I'm mexican, and i've tried better tacos than that! For the price, the food amount wasn't that much, that's another thing i wasn't impressed with. Me and my friend were celebrating our senior graduation there and we wanted to eat in the patio. First of all the patio isn't outside, and i agree with someone else's comment saying that it seemed like a garage with the walls around it.\",\n",

The first time, my friend and I had egg deliciousness--omelets, to be precise. I had an egg white, artichoke heart, feta, spinach-amazing special; she had the tomatillo scramble. Both very tasty. Service was fantastically fast and we were seated right away, granted in very close quarters to our fellow diners. Very loud, could almost hear the chewing of the guests to the right of us. Anyway. Forward to time #2. Terrible service and a meh-quality chopped salad. My husband had an omelet and it was....an omelet. Just that, something we could have made equally good or better at home, nothing incredible. But worst of all was the SERVICE, or lack thereof. We waited about 15 minutes just to have our drink order taken, by which point we had already made food decisions. We never saw our server again until we were waiting.... and waiting.... and waiting.... for our check and finally had to ask for it.

And now there's a menu change. Several items have been added, but only one new one that matters to me.  At lunch on Sundays Glenn's has had their San Francisco Cioppino on the menu. It's called San Francisco's answer to bouillabaisse. It a fabulous thick tomato based soup of lots of delicious seafoods, from shrimp and scallops to whatever whitefish they choose to put in. I've only had a taste of it before, when my wife ordered it on a Sunday afternoon. But NOW, it's on the dinner menu too. So cioppino it was for me. It's absolutely delicious with piles of fresh seafood. Seafood nirvana, as always at Glenn's.  The portion is so large I had plenty to take home for another meal.

       "  'Deep dish pizza is synonymous with Chicago and it would truly be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions if I ordered anything else..aka...thin crust. I heard through the grapevines that Gino\\'s was the provider of a most succulent meat pie, therefore, our motley crew walked there on our first night there. We were greeted by a line that snaked into an alley. Lines=legendary place right? Even though there was a line, we were quickly seated. Our party of 7 was marched up to the third floor where we got to eat outside and had a beautiful view of Chicago. You can\\'t help but notice that there is graffiti and tagging everywhere. I read some yelpers say that it was tacky. I loved it-knowing that you can scribble your name or whatever obscenity you like on a brick that will survive the test of time is pretty rad. We ordered the sausage deep dish and combo deep dish and it was pretty expensive...about 30 bucks a pie for 8 slices. However, there was a beer special and that made up for it. The pies were going to take 45 minutes so we ordered a plate of fries. I don\\'t know if I was just hungry, as all I had that day was a bagel and some airplane peanuts but the fries were the best fries I\\'ve ever had. I will emphasize in caps: THE FRIES WERE THE BEST FRIES I\\'VE EVER HAD. I am sitting in my computer chair right now wishing I could fly to chicago for them. The deep dish pizzas finally came out and after our first bites and a pretentious and faux eye roll to the back of the head like \"zomg i\\'m cumming\", we shamefully agreed after that it wasn\\'t even that great. We just said that for the sake of it being a supposedly legendary entity, much like the Loch Ness. It was like eating a pizza stacked upon another pizza stacked upon another pizza aka an incredibly thick pizza. It made me full for sure, but it was not what it was made out to be. Maybe it is because I am not a pizza connoisseur, however the general consensus of team bvu and friends was that it was alrite. If you go to the bars however, you can stock up on 3 dollar lemon drops and kamikazes. That always deserves a fist pump. The pizza was alrite however the fries were heavenly. Also, they are only 2 bucks for a huge platter. At the end, we dared to be rebels and tagged our names and various phrases on the lights upstairs. I think they will be washed tho....drats.',\n",

Since we had a large group, we asked the waiter to place orders for us and he did a great job. He explained every dish to us and brought dishes in groups (e.g. breads/cheeses, meats, seafood, etc). The bread they bring in the beginning was awesome! It's like just bruschetta (sp?) and crunchy. I don't remember the names of any of the tapas we ordered but you won't be disappointed. They had this green pepper w/cheese dip, which was awesome. We ordered sangria and I liked it even though it's sweet. The service was great and our waiter was top-notch.

       "  \"Small plate dining has taken over. And I like it! Davanti is a fun and reasonably priced restaurant with a lot of good food offerings, with a great wine selection to pair. They dont take reservations, so the wait can be long. But you'll have fun sitting at their wine bar or just go grab a coctail around the corner. They have a great selection of anti pasti, like fresh cheeses and nice meats to go with. IIt would be fun to just sit at the bar with a bottle of wine and munch away on a large selecion of these. The Marscapone polenta with ragu of the day is pretty good. It didnt blow me away with flavor and it's pretty filling. So you may want to reconsider so you can try some other good stuff. Great way to start is the chicken liver pate and the ricotta with honey. We gobbled these down instantly.The white anchovies are awesome. Really good texture and flavor going on with this dish. Dont let anchovie scare you. They're not as salty and much more meaty than the ones you may be use to. Truffle Egg Toast, wow is this good. We ordered 2...Pork belly was good. Not the best I've ever had, but the apple was a smart pairing. The linguine with the sea urchin and crab was a show stealer. Rich, creamy, and perfect balance of flavor. The Roasted cherry tomatoes with burrata and basil is a nice refreshing balance of flavor. Goes great with red wine. Seared octopus and seared halibut are awesome protien dishes. Davanti is new, lively, and has menu full of good items worth coming back and back for.\",\n",

I opted for the pineapple pork tacos and my friend got the maple braised pork. I think I ended up mistakenly saying I got the maple braised pork when the server was asking who got what and I think I also ate most of it. Best food snatching move EVER. I mean the pineapple pork tacos were well made but I think the maple braised pork was much more tender and succulent and I couldn't stop shoveling it in my face. The pork in the pineapple pork was a little too jerky and rough for me and I didn't enjoy that one as much. Not as much as everyone raves.

Simply It was nearby and well-reviewed, so we decided to hobble on over and check things out. Our ravenous, aching asses rejoiced when appetizers arrived soon after they were ordered. The avocado wontons--fresh avocado and cream cheese in a crispy wrapper--were more refreshing than any fried appetizer has a right to be. A banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice cake was a little bland, but the accompanying soy-based dipping sauce solved that minor problem.I fretted that a mere bowl of soup wouldn't be enough to calm my angry stomach. Thankfully, my cauldron of beef Pho, with its flavorful broth, tons of rice noodles, and big side plate-o-fixins (fresh cilantro and basil leaves, hot peppers, plum sauce, etc.), managed to both warm and fill me up. Significant Other's catfish in a clay pot was spicily sauced, perfectly cooked, and not fishy-tasting at all. We cleared our plates and felt pleasantly full. Traumatic recent memories of trying to will my uncooperative legs to move and panting, Slow...down, at Significant Other disappeared in a puff of Pho-scented steam. A corkage fee-free BYOB policy brought a smile to my wind-burned face (a six-pack of New Holland Brewery's winter ale didn't hurt either), and the orange slices and puffed rice cakes that rounded out our meal were nice, too. I'll be running (OK, probably briskly walking) back to sample more of the menu and take advantage of their lunch specials.\",\n",

So yes, it is very difficult to get reservations here, especially at a reasonable dinner time. But it was SOOOO worth it! My girlfriend and I agree, it was the most EPIC meal of our lives. The service, presentation of the dishes, flavor combinations, everything was just spectacular. It's an experience like none other. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert. The chef comes out and makes it for you right on your table! I wish I could come back here for dinner every month, if only it wasn't incredibly expensive.

He was very helpful and definitely navigated us through the experience. If you go, make sure to ask to try the house specialties, both drink and meat, you won't be disappointed! Also if you are a dessert person, try the banana foster pie. I am not a pie person but this dessert was unbelievably good.

Actually,we where there at 6:15pm, however we where looking for the parking for 25 minutes. The restaurant doesn't have any parking at all including valet. When we came in and I showed my Travelzoo coupon we where told that our table was given to somebody else,because we where late and we have to wait for a next available table. My husband and I spend one hour and fifteen minutes at the bar. However, at 8:15pm I saw three empty tables. I came to manager and he told me people are late, but they call and he is holding tables for them and I have to wait until 9:15pm just maybe somebody didn't show up. At that time my evening was already ruined and I asked manager why nobody told me about their policy at the time of reservation. The manager respond was the restaurant don't have to do it. Than I got mad, and was ready to walk out, the manager said the restaurant will pay for our two drinks( $7.00 each). I don't think it is enough for spoiled B-day and Saturday evening. I also sure it is happened because I showed my coupon and manager didn't want to accept it because it was busy Saturday night.

I have heard http://Yelp.com is a scam and the reviews are very biased but I never really thought much about it. Now I know its true. I will never use Yelp again or believe any of the comments in here. No wonder this horrible restaurant manages to have such a good rating. Americans, beware!! They will cheat with the food you eat!! I\\'m a Korean born immigrant living in Chicago and I took a couple of my friends out to this place because I wanted to give them some \"taste of Korea.\" The experience was absolutely horrible. The servers were so rude they refused to greet us or even answer our questions properly; they didn\\'t even look at us in the eye! We sat down and ordered some Galbi (ribs) and Chadolbegi (Korean beef) because apparently, BBQ was what the place was known for. To my unpleasant surprise, Galbi was just a collection of some cheap scrap meat with bits and pieces of rib bones lying around. and Chadolbegi meat was so hard I could not even chew on in -its supposed to be sliced paper thin and very tender. I could tell the meat was sitting in the fridge for a very very long time. When I protested, the server INSISTED that it was the proper way of serving and I don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about because supposedly I\\'ve \"never had it before\" !!! When she found out I was Korean, she still insisted I didn\\'t know jack shit because I was too young (I\\'m 25)!! When I told her I have been to many Korean restaurants and this kind of food and service were unacceptable, she gave me this look \"so what the hell can you do about it.\" So here is my response. I was so embarrassed that was the kind of people place that could potentially represent, or at least, give first impressions of Korean culture to Americans. Do not go there people. They will try to cheat you with food. And I can see many reviewers left many positive comments even though they acknowledge their experience wasn\\'t entirely a pleasant one. To that, I say there is a difference between being tolerant and open to other cultures, and just being a douche. You know the place sucks. Don\\'t promote it.',\n",

I may or may not have had this conversation with a perfectly cooked animal at a communal table. I may or may not have friends anymore. The Publican's got a great number of things down to a science. Their standing area is genius and delicious. Beers, oysters, and cheese plates while we wait. Magic. The grape, burrata, and almond salad unleashed my gitty school girl like summer just started. The grapes were inexplicably flavorful, and every bite just sung in my mouth. And Pavlova was on the dessert menu. This tugged on my nostalgia chords, as my mother (who collects cookbooks to look at, and never to utilize) used to actually make this for me and my brother. Not something you typically see on menus, and I'm not sure why. It was perfect, and better than my mothers. Yes, I told her that. HOWEVER, the Honey Pudding stole the dessert show. So creative and ballsy. Bourbon peach, almond streusel and honey black pepper ice cream? Unicorn tears were no doubt the secret ingredient in this little ditty. Great beer selection, amazing service, tons of seafood, and great company! My only complaint is that it's loud as hell, but the Publican can't help it's so popular!\",\n",

We just did the prixe-fixe menu and we all loved it! Words like...mouthwatering, so tender, you have to try this....were uttered continuously. The presentation of the food was of course exquisite, but the taste was also! This is a fine-dining experience, so of course the portions are smaller-sized....but iall four of us were absolutely stuffed at the end of our meal - to the point 2 of us couldn't even eat the little chocolates provided at the end. The sommelier was perfect in his recommendations - we left the decision-making to him, within a price range, and he absolutely delivered - the wine choices fit our food and our palates and our budgets.

I went with some of these friends and my boyfriend around 8:30PM. The pizza smelled good, but it did not taste very well or look appetizing. The pizza dough was more bread-like, which is OK in my book, but the sauce looked like tomato soup on top of bread. It even sloshed around when the waitress placed it on the table. And where was the cheese? I don't know. My boyfriend and I both were trying to find it under the soupy sauce. The sauce reminded me of watery tomatoes with extra seasoning to compensate for the lack of cheese and thickness of the sauce. One of my coworkers, who had gone before and enjoyed the pizza, stated he had a similar problem close to closing time. Even though 8:30-9:00PM on a weekend is not that close to closing when I went, I just don't know what happened. My boyfriend and I were not impressed and will not go back. Good luck and best wishes for this place and its customers.\",\n",

The bar itself is really awesome inside and the band that accompanied the poets was jazzy and impressive. I had a Bloody Mary and a Lemon Martini. The Bloody Mary wasn\\'t as spicy as it could have been, but still had a very good flavor. The lemon martini was ok. The wait staff was very nice, but the person at the door collecting $6.00 for the show could have been a bit nicer, and have spoken to the people paying, and not have man-handled people who weren\\'t aware that they had to pay. I was the first one at my table and as soon as I sat down the manager/bouncer lady swooped in and demanded to know if I was going to be the only one. I told her no, that I was expecting two or three more people. Throughout the first hour of the night she hid by the door and glared in my direction, waiting for the opportunity to remove me from the table if others didn\\'t show soon. My two friends arrived and the woman appeared again, asking if we were expecting more people. When we said no, she snapped, \"I\\'ll be seating two more people here then. This table seats five!\" and then stormed off. As the intermission of the show ended and the band geared up to play again, we sat in the back, very close to the exit, and talked amongst ourselves as people in the audience yelled out to the performers on stage. I don\\'t know how this lady did it, but she appeared from the darkness without us noticing and demanded that we lower our voices and stop speaking as there were people on stage. Awkward. The show ended at 10:00 and we stayed at the Green Mill for another hour as everyone filed out of the bar. Swiftly gliding past, the woman placed a sheet of paper on our table explaining how patrons should remain quiet during the shows because of the musicians and performers on stage. Again, this was an hour after the show. The Green Mill was cool and all, but it seems some of the staff would rather give a big F-you instead of a Thank You for coming!',\n",

One side of the menu offered Thai food while the other side offered sushi. What to do... what to do... Pondering my decision, I made a quick scan around the room. There was a big group celebrating at a table in front of us. They definitely were members of the cool kids club. I wouldn't mind being a voyeur for a few moments but my stomach had its own ideas. Looking back at the menu I decided to get the sweet potato roll and the salmon and avocado rolls. The consistency of the sushi tasted spongey but in a good way. I don't think I've ever tasted sushi like this before. My girlfriend had a couple of pieces of salmon with quail eggs on top. That was awesome! I don't think I can get sushi with quail eggs in Houston. As I though about that fact, I got sad.\",\n",

Although the restaurant gets busy, there is always someone to help and you're never left waiting for a long time. My personal favorite is the spanakotiropita! For a healthier option, I would highly recommend the stuffed bell peppers. At some restaurants, peppers can come out soggy, but not at Greek Islands! Pair it with a salad and you're good to go!

I have sampled Turkey Burgers all over The Chicago land area. I've gone from fancy hotels to bars and it just doesn't compare to The 3 Coast Cafes version. This is my secret indulgence I wait for once a week.I get it with grilled mushrooms and a slice of Swiss. They give you all the fixings on the side (which I like) lettuce tomato etc... Every bite is Hot, Juicy, Moist and Delicious. Not easy to do with Turkey. The mix of flavors just melt in your mouth with every bite. Amazing !\",\n",

       "  \"I loved the food here! We were given complimentary popcorn seasoned with truffle oil, parmesan, and pepper, which was a great, tasty starter. We went with the five-course tasting menu that came with a deconstructed caesar salad, butternut bisque, seared scallops, wagyu beef, and s'mores. We also ordered the fois gras with pop rocks, which was amazing. The lettuce of the caesar salad was perfectly seasoned and came with a delicious brioche twinkie. The scallops were cooked to perfection with a sweet coffee sauce. This is the best scallops i've tasted. The wagyu beef was perfectly cooked as well and came with a warm, comforting truffle consommee, root vegetables and sprinkled with freshly shaved truffles. The s'mores came with a delicious peanut butter ice cream. The only dish I did not love was the bisque because of its strong ginger flavor. The presentation of the food was interesting. All of the liquids came in science lab glassware - think Erlenmeyers and beakers.  The only downside was the portion sizes for the five-course tasting menu are very small. I felt bad for my husband because I knew he left hungry. If we go back, which I hope we do, we will either order the ten-course menu or order a la carte, which apparently is larger portions. The wait staff is dressed casually and lends an unpretentious vibe to what should otherwise be a fancy restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. We were served by a number of other people throughout the meal and they were all very nice.\",\n",

       "  \"Love led me to Grand Lux Cafe. For serious. Why else would a sane Chicago resident venture in at 8 pm on a saturday night - wait for it - the weekend before St. Pat's? A friend was celebrating his 40th, and for reasons unbeknownst to me, this is the spot he chose for dinner. When we arrived, the entire foyer was crammed with tourists, loud-talkers with shopping bags, and an unfathomable amount of non-Irish strutting out the greenery. In other words, we had arrived on the 4th level of hell - forgot to mention this didn't you Dante? After a relatively short wait due to extenuating cirumstances, we were told to go upstairs where we again waited for a short time before being seated. Please note, your wait will be longer - much longer. Sorry. Upon being seated, there appeared to be a controlled orderly chaos surrounding us. Expediters, waitresses, random important people wearing black, all buzzed around and somehow made it all work. Our server, Rachel, was delightful. She knew the menu, was able to make recommendations, and overall kept everything moving along perfectly. The food is basically the big brother to Cheesecake Factory, though to be honest, I prefer the latter. There are plenty of menu choices, and sure, most of it sounds good, but it seemed to be lacking something. I would be curious to try the brunch menu, but honestly, I can't imagine it being worth the trip. Overall, it's good for what it is, but nothing special.\",\n",

I recommend this place to everyone I meet vegetarian/vegan/ or otherwise and specifically created a yelp account to give them a rating they deserve. I'm not from the area, (about an hour north of the restaurant itself) but I always make it a point to head into the city specifically to eat here. The interior is nice and cozy, but due to the small size of the building and popularity of the restaurant, the wait may be a little longer than you're used to in the evening. Service is excellent, employees are always very friendly and prompt.The vegan shakes are the best I've ever had. All of them are incredible, but my favorite has to be chocolate chip cookie dough. I have never been able to stomach sweet potato fries, that said-- the sweet potato fries here are perfectly crispy and by far the best side on the menu.The seitan is really good as well. Consequentially, I'm a huge fan of their many sandwiches. Rueben, BLT, and Gyros at the top of my list for entrees although nothing can top the vegan philly cheese steak.If you're in the mood for something sweet I'd recommend the cake or better yet--- cinnamon rolls. The Chicago Diner is really great in every aspect. If you haven't stopped by yet, be sure to!\",\n",

First of all, go early (5 pm on a weekday, much earlier on a weekend), or you'll be relegated to the bar area where the service seems spurious. I did admire the ease with which the kitchen turned out dishes, very fast, very efficient, high quality. I'm not sure why I want to hate this place.

       "  \"Last spring my husband and I traveled to Italy. While in Naples - the birthplace of pizza - we ate at Pizzeria da Michele, one of the most famous pizza places in Naples. Ever since that trip I have been craving that unique taste. It's the combination of the San Marzano tomatoes, the mozzarella di bufala and the high heat of the oven that you can't get just anywhere.Then I read about Spacca Napoli. Two weeks ago on a Saturday night, my husband and I tried Spacca Napoli. It was crowded, though that is expected on a Saturday night. We waited 30-40 minutes for a table, but it was fun watching the open kitchen and seeing just how quickly the pizza is cooked (less than 80 seconds!). The owner was playing host and was friendly, passing out delicious apps to the people waiting.We had a chance to look over the menu while we were waiting, so when we were seated it didn't take us long to order. I only wanted the Bufalina, which is essentially the Margherita I ordered in Naples. Very simple pizza - tomato sauce, buffalo mozz and a touch of basil leaves on a deliciously thin, chewy crust. My husband ordered the Bianca con Bufala, which was essentially the same, minus the tomato sauce. (FYI, the prices, when converted to Euros, was almost exactly the same as in Naples.)Our waitress was very friendly. We ordered lemon sodas, as we had everywhere we went in Italy. Our pizzas came out fast, but not before the owner stopped by our table to offer us a piece of deliciously fried mozzarella.When the waitress set the pizza in front of me, I teared up. It smelled exactly the way the pizza in Naples did. It really took me back to our wonderful trip. More importantly, the pizza TASTED the same. Very authentic. My husband's pizza bianca was also delicious. I also loved how they served it with a knife & fork, just like in Naples. This isn't typical NY pizza.We thanked the owner as we left and told him how wonderful it was to relive a small part of our trip. He was very friendly and seemed genuinely thrilled it measured up to our expectations. He also handed us tiny canolis that were to-die-for!We'll be back when we need a taste of Italy again!\",\n",

       "  \"Davanti is as good as it gets and will definitely be my new go-to place to take out of towners and give as a suggestion when friends quiz me on where to dine. Our dinner for three started out at the bar with wine, appetizers, and $5 martinis. Patrick (manager? GM? owner?) gave us some fabulous suggestions for starters and was incredibly accommodating. He seated us promptly, carried over our drinks/appetizers from the bar to the table, and even brought us little samples of their house infused martini (current selection is cantaloupe - TDF). We later learned that Davanti is associated with Mia Franceca and Francesca's and that he helps to the run the sister restaurants. I consider all of those places super lucky to have Patrick, he is truly an asset to the industry. Among our small plates was the ricotta and honeycomb spread, chicken liver pate, cheese selection/prosciutto, olives, and pizza. My favorite was the ricotta/honey spread which is served in a mason jar with chewy toasted bread (we ordered extra bread per Patrick's suggestion, you definitely need more than three slices). It was such a unique flavor combo and was very light and sweet (but not as sweet as a dessert). The olives were served warm which is a new thing for me but I have to say I liked it. The next best thing we had was the Pizza del Terre with leeks and mushrooms - very earth and packed with flavor. The decor and ambiance of this place is incredible. It's a new twist on rustic Italian - festive, comfortable, warm, and yet it's perfect for a date night or a girls' night out. I can't say enough good things about our night here and I'm looking forward to my next return as soon as possible. Hopefully they'll have a new house infused martini for me to try (pineapple?! please?!). My only suggestion would be to hire a valet parking service. We had a hard time finding parking even at 8:30 on a Wednesday night and valet would have been great for the cold weather.\",\n",

There is a small parking lot that had plenty of spots available, so that was good. Staff was super friendly and helpful as I ordered a Cuban sandwich, Ropa Vieja dinner, goat cheese empanada, mango and mamey (never heard of that, but counter girl suggested it) shakes. We were lucky enough to get two of the 10(ish) stools in there. It would kinda suck to go there and order food and not be able to sit down and eat it. Food came out quickly. Presentation was fine, and food was excellent. I've never had a Cuban sandwich and it was yum, but I think a few more plantain chips would've been good...there were like 8 small chips on the side. Ropa Vieja was really great, served with rice, black beans, and plantains. The empanada was smallish for the price and we got beef instead of goat cheese as ordered, so bummer, but we ate anyway it and it was tasty. They aren't giving anything away here...$32 for lunch, so it was a bit pricey considering the small space. Nothing against a dive-y place, but they don't even have a bathroom. I suppose it would be nice to sit outside there, but again, there's the bathroom thing. Since the food was so great I would love to go back, but I would try the other location which looks like it has more seating...like a regular restaurant. I'm sure I will be craving that Ropa Vieja sooner than later...\",\n",

       "  'So I wondered if the owner even knew what Xoco meant, where the term came from and how it has influenced millenniums of languages from Mayan to Aztec to Tlahuica, Catalan, and English. Now admittedly, having lived and worked in Mexico for a couple of years, I am quick to disregard the typical \"authentic Mexican food\" slogan that is all too often splashed across the tackily-lit restaurant signs of Mexican restaurants. Of course, being in the loop, and on this celebratory Saturday, the sign was nil, as would be expected, and the slogan MIA. With all the ranting and raving of Chicago\\'s best Mexican cuisine chef , who is not Mexican BTW, still left me questioning--can he really be that good??? As we waited in line for 45 minutes to place our order and be seated I smart-assedly (sp.) decided to test my theory and pick one of the most authentic Mexican food items I could find, cochinita pibil. As you may have noticed, I already began the process of self-deprecation because what I got this perfect, celebratory, luck-filled, joyous Saturday afternoon was nothing other than true, exquisite, Mexican-style roasted pork with achiote, laden with perfectly pickled red onions--just as you would find in Central Mexico. The preparation was so perfect I did away with the bread and enjoyed the savory roasted flavor of my cochinita pibil. I don\\'t think we could have followed up the dyeing of the Chicago River with a more perfect lunch than the one we had at Xoco. I have every intention of returning to Xoco to try the Jalisco-region famed Torta Ahogada, which I\\'ve had only once but made a lasting impression on me. I can\\'t wait to work my way down the menu..... Provecho!',\n",

It was also VERY loud. We couldn't hear each other speak across the table. They also informed us they had no booths available, so we were sitting at a tiny table, by a major thoroughfare, and everyone kept bumping into us.

Last year, although I had called to confirm my reservation numerous times, they did not have enough seats for my whole party, nor would they have even been able to fit everyone at one table, so part of my group had to be separated. A booth opened nearby, so it wasn't the end of the world. For some reason we decided to go back again this year (probably just because pizza is an easy thing to deal with for a big group to share). Again, I had called numerous times to confirm everything with our reservation to ensure we did not encounter any problems. I was assured everything was ready. We got there early/on time for our 8:00 reservation, and were told that there was another party seated where they were planning on seating us, and we'd have to wait for them to leave. There were 10 of us waiting around and it was HOT and CROWDED. There was nowhere for us to stand and they apparently did not know how to regulate the temperature in the restaurant.  FINALLY, after waiting 45 minutes after our reservation time, we were seated (probably because after 35 minutes I finally asked the party that was at 'our table' if they would be leaving any time soon, which I would NEVER normally do, but at that point we were pretty hungry and pretty pissed, and the manager clearly wasn't going to do anything about it).  All of that being said, I understand sometimes things like that happen, but ALWAYS when I've been in a situation along the lines of the restaurant screwing something up, they've tried to do something to accommodate us. This manager (Sean) only offered to pick up the tab on ONE pitcher of beer (again, there were 10 of us who had waited 45 minutes for our table, plus another 20 for the pizzas we had pre-ordered), and even that was only after I had asked him to do something for us. Seriously? The best you could do is one pitcher of beer for a party of 10 people?? Pathetic. I will say that I actually felt bad for the waitress. She was VERY nice and I wish her all the best in finding a much better place to work than Pequod's, as I can't begin to comprehend why she (or anyone else for that matter) would want to work there. In any case, we will NEVER go back to Pequod's after that AWFUL experience. There is MUCH better pizza out there with MUCH better restaurant management.\",\n",

UPDATE: 3/17/08 went back again with a few newbies and even though we had no reservations and they were expecting a full house, they accommodated us, by the chef\\'s request. everyone that works there is from the logan square area and they will do all they can do to hookup a fellow neighbor. Good people work here, they get an xtra star.',\n",

It is basically all gawkers and tourists now who go and will wait b/c they will not be back in town. The food is good, authentic, and delicious...but certainly not worth more than an hour wait. I think they may even be trying to scare people off with overblown estimated wait times, just to move the tourists through faster. If you are a Chicago area resident, only go during the week if you want to get in a reasonable time. Otherwise, the new Xoco is a fine alternative...even if the wait there is 30+ min as well for a sandwich.',\n",

I was just way too excited for my own good about going to this place. Well, believe it or not, this place met, no EXCEEDED, my expectations. How is that even possible? No clue. I mean I really love sausage more than the average person (I blame my German heritage for that) but these are the best sausages I have ever had. When I went I ordered the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri, Crispy Fried Onions and Carrigaline Farmhouse Cheese and I ordered this Portuguese linguica sausage with some kind of smoky cheese on top. The ribeye steak sausage was very good but the Portuguese linguica sausage. OH. MY. GOD. I need a new paragraph just to describe this sausage. I'm not sure if it was the sausage itself that was so good or the combination of it with that smoky cheese but this was seriously the best encased meat meal I have ever experienced. I dream of this sausage. And Hot Doug's has now become my benchmark for all things sausage-related. I also tried the duck fat fries and thought they tasted like nothing special. Someone I was with bought the normal fries so we could compare and, yes, you can taste a difference but nothing substantial. I would recommend just getting sausages and no fries. Save room for the good stuff! As far as the wait goes, we got there at 10:45am on a Friday and only had to wait about a 10 minutes wait which I know is unusual. I've driven by this place on the weekend and seen the line stretch for blocks. I can't wait to go back - these sausages are worth a 2 hour wait in the Chicago winter.\",\n",

I would say that if you gave up meat because you dislike the taste of meat, some of these dishes might not be for you. Their chicken fried steak fooled my meat eating friends.

Even if there is a table available my husband and I like to sit at the bar for just one drink and enjoy before we sit down to eat. I love to watch the bartenders make their speciality drinks. The food is fabulous too. I always get the skirt steak and venture off when I order appetizers. I just love the fish tacos too. I had been raving about this restaurant to my family and we all decided to take my mom for her birthday. We did not have reservations and just headed there. When we got there the place was packed.

I took the lady here last night for her birthday and couldn't have made a better choice. If you want a chicken leg the size of your aunt's thigh and four pounds of mashed potatoes don't go here. If you value well balance, excellent tasting food, with knowledgeable/helpful/enjoyable servers check out ge. They have everything a white tablecloth pierre-as-maitre d' spot wishes their food was, and it's served in a relaxed, spacious, and soothing setting. It's not cheap and it won't stuff you (so don't complain), but just go. Onion Bisque - I'll refrain as I don't prefer onions generally, but I'm sure it's good to someone normal Charred Octopus - fantastic. octopus was delicious enough to eat by the fistful, and the complements worked really well with the flavor and texture Fois Gras - Seared FG at its best. Again I could have eaten just the FG for hours, but the rhubarb/crumble/strawberry transformed it into something completely new/different/awesome Atlantic Swordfish - expertly cooked, great taste without being too fatty or creamy Colorado Lamb - the lamb of the gods with balanced backdrop of canneloni and mushrooms could not be done better, plus the interesting twist of eucalyptus froth This and four drinks were ~$220 with tax/tip and it's worth five meals anywhere else in the city, so it's actually an awesome deal. And I can't leave without saying that Whitney was an excellent server, put up with my endless questions on what the awesome things I was eating.

Even when every table is full and you are forced to stand there awkwardly while being tempted by the amazing smells, I've never waited more than 5 minutes for a table. Thank goodness. Anyway, the beef ph is awesome and it's my go-to dish. The crispy pork rolls are heavenly. Oh man. The restaurant itself is a big place that's tightly packed, and a little hectic. But I think that's part of it's charm. So if you want fantastic ph on ANY budget, go to Tank. Even at my hungriest, I've never been able to finish my entire bowl of ph in one sitting. That should be reason enough.\",\n",

I always order the smaller oysters, I discovered they usually are tastier. Be aware that sometimes it gets very crowded, there is a waiting line, and also I don't think they take reservations (at the bar).

The location is great and parking is easy! That's always a plus! I even parked on the side street and didn't have to pay! I heard good things about the sweet potato fries so we had to try them. They were indeed delicious! Nice, crispy, and full of flavor with a side of goat cheese fondue. My friend and I had been looking at the menu online and the meatloaf caught our attention, so bacon wrapped meatloaf it was for both of us! Two medium slices of an oval-shaped meatloaf wrapped in bacon and topped with caramelized onions on a bed of Yukon gold potatoes! On the side were my favorite seasonal veggies of fresh zucchini and yellow squash. Yum! Only thing is I wish the bacon was crispier, other than that, it was one good tasting meatloaf! I think I was more interested in the company and the conversation than to fully enjoy my dinner like I usually do. The place was definitely loud but happenin', and not overcrowded. I also didn't see/hear the band that was suppose to be playing tonight, but then again, it may have been too hard to talk. I'd love to go back and try brunch sometime!\",\n",

My party had 7 people in it. The only minus which why the four stars and not 5 was that i made a reservation early and may moved it because of nato and then switched it to June. I talked to the hostess Gretchen because I needed to change the time and she assured me we would be fine and we ended up having to wait still about 30 minutes when we got there. They tried to give us the high seated tables and my aunts and parents are older they need to be as close to the ground as possible. wth So my favorite from the harvest table was the Duck Confit Hash Browns and the strawberry salad. I also ate about three red velvet cupcakes. For the entrees. I loved the chicken and waffles, the bottom sirloin, and the roasted turkey. The worst: the corned beef hash, the frittata, and the crab Benedict fell flat for me. The decor is gorg very peaceful and zen like and relaxing. There was also a noisy birthday party going on with a magician. I went up to check out the rooftop and its really cute. I would do the brunch again with less people of course.

For two people, paying exactly $100 including tip for a couple of beers, oysters, pork grinds, and a couple of side dishes is not ridiculous for a great restaurant like this but certainly was expensive.

I always ask if there is a table available in the library, sometimes you get lucky!The staff is always attentive and efficient and most of the time they are super friendly.and the food...I love the pancakes here! They are my favorite item on the menu. They are lighty and kinda fluffy, but they have this amazing eggy taste to them that makes them really unique and delicious. No matter what else I order I always get a short stack on the side.I have never ordered anything i did not like, but i am a creature of habit and get the same few things everytime. The Granola is amazing (though I think it is just crushed up cookies), the Chef's Egg Sandwich is great and the Eggs Benedict is remarkable, though I order it mithout the tomato. The Baked Brie and Egg is really good too, but not for everyone. For dinner the Shepherd's Pie and the Mac and Cheese are great choices and the roast Chicken is good,Everytime I go in I tell myself to get something new, but the old favorites are so good I just keep going back to them.As wonderful as I think the place is I am amazed I have never waited for a table on a Sunday morning! So many times brunch is ruined by having to wait an hour for a table. I have never waited more than a few minutes at Wilde....huge plus!\",\n",

A full brunch for 4 came out to under $60, so not bad. Lack of booze can sometimes be considered a huge miss for brunch, but still a great place.

You're plate will fill so fast you'll be racing to flip to red just to get a breather. Their salad bar is massive and offers the freshest ingredients - my favorites would be their fresh mushrooms and hearts of palm. If you like cheese, you can also partake in their cheese wheels.

I probably wouldn't order it again. Not because it was bad, but because it was just meh. I was hungry and ate it but could do without it. The shining star was the black bean burger.

       "  \"So I would say the only downer about Hopleaf is the wait time, but hey I mean it is actually really worth it! So we went here last night, and it was my second time being here. The last time, we went on a weekend and it was two hour wait, so I guess our 40 minute wait this time was a big improvement. (ok and I guess the smaller party of four helped out with that too) We shared the mussels (belgain style) appetizer for two and the grilled shrimp to start. The mussels for two were plently for our table of four to share, the white wine broth is delicious and I wanted to drink it, but I thought that would look bad at the table so I settled for pouring large quantities of the broth on my plate so I could soak it up with my bread.  The mussels come with pomme frites that feel like they just came out of the deep fryer and when you dip the hot crispy fry into the garlicy aoli that comes with the mussels, you feel like you are in fry heaven! It doesn't matter that you know it is totally not good for you, you just want to know when you have the next fry! I didn't care too much for the grilled shrimp, it was literally just grilled shrimp and they only gave you three of them, not so good for a party of four!  Entree wise, I had the duck ruben - it was probably the BEST ruben I have ever had...funny that it is a duck ruben...but everything about this ruben is awesome. From the bread that is perfectly toasted, yet still soft and buttery, to the thick juicy pieces of duck wedged in the swiss cheese that is melted just so, to the tangy tartness of the sauerkraunt, this ruben kicks butt! I had the other half for leftovers today and I am sad that it is all gone. Plus the ruben comes with MORE fries and that yummy garlicy aoli sauce. My friend had the trout, I had a bite of it and that was really fresh and well done. Trout is hard to prepare in a restaurant and Hopleaf managed to pull it off. It was not dry at all, and you could taste how fresh it was, the combination of the cold curry cucumber salad coupled with the hot tender trout was soo yummy! I only wish that hopleaf was closer to my place and didn't require such a long wait, but hey it is totally worth it!\",\n",

Ethiopian Diamond can get pretty expensive (special occassion expensive) if you want to add on drinks and appetizers that's why we prefer Demera over Ethiopiam Diamond. The food at Demera isn't quite as good as Ethiopian Diamond because they're lamb and other meat dishes are hit or miss. If you like black injera you can order it ahead of time and they'll serve your meal with it. The honey wine is delicious and they make their own which they open on Fridays so get there before the weekend is over because they run out quickly. They do have bottled honey wine that should suffice if the run out of the home brew. One thing we've noticed is that the night time service has new management and they are pretty annoying. The head manager told us about how the old servers (off the boat Ethiopian servers) couldn't even open a bottle of wine. I thought that was pretty unprofessional to be gloating about how badly they needed new management especially when it has made the atmosphere seem so much less like authentic Ethiopian dining. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think people would be much happier feeling like they were not in a steak house (where the new manager came from) and in a family owned Ethiopian Restaurant. Overall, the food hasn't changed since the new management and that's the biggest draw for me so I still give Demera 4 stars!\",\n",

I had duck heart for the first time and loved it...probably wouldn\\'t have ordered it for myself. The deep pockets are needed because they only carry top shelf hooch and serve hip euro-peasent food at aristocratic prices. If you go, you have got to get the Basque (fish) stew.

       "  \"Saving the big 300 for an exceptional dining experience. All restaurants should have service of this level. Five stars all the way for TRU. Service, ambiance, food quality and aesthetics - every aspect of our experience was magnificent. Upon walking in, we were immediately shown to our table (we were seated in an intimate corner of the restaurant) and two servers lifted and moved the table so I could be seated and get comfortable. Yes, all of the other tables had stools for pocketbooks (very thoughtful), but I didn't need one as I was sitting on one of their benches.  The ambiance is perfect. Clean lines, contemporary, luxurious and modern, but with a bit of traditionalism. Tables are spaced perfectly so we could share an intimate dinner. BF had called ahead and had them personalize our menu for our celebration (we later took home the menu and they printed out a separate menu for us with all the dishes we had). It was truly special. Immediately we were served a buffalo mozzarella palette cleanser, a great way to start the evening. We decide to go with the Chef's collection as it was more in line with our palettes.  16-courses of delight. My personal favorites were: Selection of Sashimi Grade Fish, Complementary Garnishes Rabbit Consomm, Morels, Pea & Lavender Emulsion Whipped Salt Cod, Creamy Potato, Smoked Gele, Caviar Tagliolini, Peeky Toe Crab, Uni Poached American Red Snapper, Green Papaya, Fennel, Thai Nage Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse, Orange Sherbet, Cardamom Scented Oranges - This may be the best chocolate dessert I've ever experienced. Fresh ingredients, incredible flavor profiles, perfect amount of innovation and a great balance of light and heavier courses. They brought out a special dessert to celebrate our occasion, which was a fantastic little chocolate cake. Just when we thought we were done, they came by with a plate of truffles... and then the cart of pastries and candies. We were so full, we asked if we could have a doggie bag. Sure enough, they brought out two boxes and sent us home with a great assortment of chocolate and candies.  I cannot say enough about the service we received. Approximately 5-7 people served our table, perfectly synchronized from clearing our plates, filling our wine and water to describing each dish to perfection. Staff was very courteous, delightfully charming and always smiling. On our way out, they gave us two loaves of iced lemon pound cake for breakfast! 48 hours later, and I'm still thinking about our experience at TRU...\",\n",

The waitress sat us outside. It looked like it was about to rain but we figured if it did we would move inside. While waiting to put in our drink order some transient approached us in the enclosed patio dining area and asked for money.We were at the restaurant for two hours! Two other tables got up and left after getting only water because the service was so slow. We ordered one appetizer and one main dish. The waitress forgot to bring me a beer that I ordered and almost never checked on our water glasses. I asked another waitress to get the beer since ours had disappeared. When the bill came I paid it. However, the waitress came back and said she forgot to ring the beer she forgot to bring and one of the glasses of honeywine that my girlfriend drank. I guess I thought maybe the beer was on the house since I waited 20 minutes for it and had to order it twice. The waitress then proceeded to ring up another check for the beer and wine so I had to run my card twice.All in all, the food was okay but the service sucked. The waitress provided no guidance on what to order even though we inquired. I liked the appetizer and drinks but the main dish was over priced and the bread they serve has a very strong vinegar taste which I did not like much.If you think you are in the mood to try Ethiopian food at Demera, I would suggest you just go to your favorite mediterranean restaurant because, although not indentical, some of the dishes/tastes are fairly similar.',\n",

There's nothing worse than paying big $ for Belgian beer only to find that the flavor is muted and stale. Bartenders never believe me on this, either, since I'm not the stereotypical beer-drinker (read: bearded, burly dude). Hopleaf's taps are *always* fresh. The combination of consistent quality plus a very interesting, ever-changing beer list makes for unrivaled educational boozing. The food is fabulous, too. Prices are a little steep in the absolute sense, but you get a really amazing meal for what you pay. Their menu has elements of Belgian, French and New American cuisine. It's interesting yet simple, wholesome, and tasty. That said, you have to be strategic when coming here due to the crowds. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, show up on the early side even if you're just drinking (6-7). You may still need ninja-esque skills to grab a table, even this early, but it's likely you'll grab one before too long. They'll serve food to the bar area, but if you want to eat in the restaurant (it's nicer) on a Thurs.-Saturday, put your name down by 6:00 or you could easily be waiting until 10:00. The Map Room is the only place that rivals Hopleaf in terms of beer selection and tap beer quality, and it's plagued by the same crazy crowds. The Map Room is a little cheaper, but it's smaller (even harder to get a seat) and they don't serve food.\",\n",

Some of the cocktails when we got there were half off -- so two drinks for the price of one (thus $5 bucks a drink). I had basically a pomegranate cosmo (it had a cool name but after two of them, I don't remember it -- those bad boys had a nice pour on them!). They were delicious and I'm certain good for you. Food: I was told beforehand about the mac and cheese so I got a small plate (caramelized onions, Irish bacon, some glorious cheeses and a garlic bread crust top. Baked to perfection (and by the order -- it was steaming hot). Fantastic. I also got a grilled chicken cesar and it was, as salads go, just fine. But I would make a special trip for the drinks and mac and cheese. My friend got grilled salmon over mash potatoes and grilled asparagus. Says it is a staple for her because it is so good. I almost pushed her down and took her plate. it smelled heavenly. I saw the next table got burgers and they smelled really good too. For dessert (yeah, so what!) we shared an apple crumble -- it was huge and fantastic. I kept telling myself that most of that would come home with me. Ha! we were licking the bottom of that thing. Decor and vibe: it feels like an old library in there, which just makes me happy. And vaguely Parisian, which makes me insanely happy. Our servers were first rate: attentive but not intrusive, full of good humor, and not one bit of attitude. Lovely all around. The vibe was nice; lots of different kinds of people there: families with kids, young boys flirting with boys, middle aged men and women flirting at the bar, lots of different colors, which was super. Nice not being the only brown dot in the room. I would (and will) go back in a heartbeat. Brunch is calling my name; and I'm told since it such a big space (I had no idea how big when I walked in) the wait on weekends is manageable. See you soon, Wilde!!!\",\n",

The place opens at 1030 and when I arrived at 1015, there was already a line about 40 people deep. I think we ended up waiting in line 35 minutes before we got to the front (counting the 15 minute wait for the place to open). I think the food's great and really hits the spot if you're looking for a hot dog, but I still don't understand the extremely long lines, even in cold temperatures. I think being aired on the Food Network has a lot to do with it. So get there early. I tried to go once before (around 2 pm) and there had to be 100 people in line.

I didn't tell him I was part Romanian because I thought his head might explode.The service was a bit slow as others pointed out, but they claimed they were down a waitress for the night so I'm not deducting for that.

The pre-sliced bread tastes and feels day-old. The service is also hit/miss, as people in my party had their meal served cold. Further, since they only take reservations for large parties, and the restaurant lacks a bar, waiting parties are forced to congregate outside, or in the 4x4 vestibule. No fun during our long cold season.My advice: Affordable Italian is commonplace. Take a pass on Cara Mio and support businesses who serve fresh food and provide competent service.',\n",

       "  \"I have been to Frontera Grill for a few corporate events (where the food was just A-OK), and went again last night (Tuesday) around 8:30 for full-on dinner. It was still very crowded (thanks, Top Chef). Great atmosphere. Margs were delicious. We ordered the basic ceviche for an app, and had the duck tacos and steak tacos for entrees. Ironically -- both the duck and steak tasted the same. Couldn't really tell the difference. Plus, could have had more ceviche and guac for the $13... Would go back, but probably to Topolobombo or XOCO first. Then, over all three, I would recommend Chilam Balam in Lakeview. That place has innovative Mexican going on...\",\n",

       "  \"As part of my birthday celebration, my wife and I went to Carnivale this past Friday night. It was our first time eating here and we walked away with a high opinion and plans to revisit in the future. For starters, the staff and waiters were very nice and helpful. We were seated within minutes upon check-in (we had 7:30PM reservations for 2) and were given a table on the second floor overlooking the main dining area. The space is beautiful. Formerly a warehouse, the place has been renovated with outdoor seating, a bar area and an adjoining main dining room with vaulted ceilings, brightly colored lamps, a huge glass mosaic and cool decorations.The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Music was playing in the background during our meal but we didn't have any trouble hearing one another. In fact, it was just loud enough to drown out your neighbors and provide a little bit of conversational privacy.We had heard positiive reviews about their mixed drinks so my wife ordered the Coconut Mojito and I ordered the Mojito Millonario. Both were good; however, I was partial to my libation. It was a few dollars more than the regular Mojito but the 12 year estate rum they used was absolutely delicious and worth the extra expense. In addition to the rum upgrade, in the Millinario they add cava (spanish sparkling wine) and forego simple syrup, which is used in the regular mojito. This made for better flavor and kick in my opinion. The food we ordered really hit the spot as well and was prepared perfectly. To start, we had the Arepas and the Ropa Vieja. Both had great flavor. The pork belly and corn cheese cakes in the former were a nice pairing. If I had to choose between the two though I would go with the Ropa Vieja. The braised beef and spicy mayo together with the other ingredients made for an incredibly tasty combination. Plus, in the RV they give you 4 little portions per plate compared to 3 on the Arepas dish. Regardless, you won't go wrong with either.For entrees we chose the Churrasco and the Bistek Palomilla. There was no clear cut winner in my mind because both dishes had unique and satisfying flavor profiles. The meat for both was cooked just right; tender but not bloody and easy to cut. My wife made the comment that the Churrasco tasted more latin american'esque while the Bistek Palomilla was more amorphous, although still excellent. She may have had a point. Regardless, the roasted mushrooms, radish salad and brisket mofongo disappeared quickly from my plate. The sweet potato puree and corn on her dish did compliment each other and the beef tenderloin very well.Since it was my birthday they brought us a free dessert, flan with bits of caramel popcorn on the plate. I didn't even see that option on the menu but it hit the spot. Definitely not the best I've ever had but since it was free I wasn't complaining. Had they not surprised us with this I would have ordered the Banana Cream Pie, which sounded awesome. Next time!\",\n",

       "  \"This is another spot we've passed a few times going to our other favorites but decided to check it out for lunch today. Sunda is nothing like I'd imagined because at first, stupid glance... you can assume that it's shallow, pretentious and sans food worth digesting. I am enthralled that was totally wrong about the good cuisine here! I started with a nice glass of Trace merlot and ordered one of the best bowls of miso I've sucked down in about 10 years... ever since my favorite Japanese place near Wrigley closed that used to make homemade sakuri mochi wrapped in toasted cherry leaf. Well this miso isn't overly-salted and is quite generous with the seaweed and tofu. WTF is up with other places skimping on something so cheap as tofu in their miso? What gives? Not Sunda. This is a nice bowl of miso that comes to the table in heavy porcelain. Next up in my lunch special were 3 tasty and most spicy tuna rolls. They're the perfect size for a lunch special and did not have me wanting to reach for wasabi. Didn't have to dip it in soy sauce. Just ate it. Finally, a huge bowl of shrimp and sea bass green curry came to the table and it was so much fish in it that a hungry guy like could me split it with my friend and we both had well enough to spill over our mounds of rice. The dish was kissed with lemongrass, peppers and pineapple in the most sensual way. i wasn't supposed to be having these erotic feelings while on the clock! I'm usually NOT a fan of green curry (prefer red or yellow) but if I can find it the way Sunda offers it, it can become my favorite. We argued about dessert and finally decided to pick both the cookie bites sampler and the thai creme anglais choc molten cake with rice crispies. We made our way through the intensely-flavored cookies bites and found that the tangerine bar (will make u say screw lemon!), molasses and brown sugar tasting cookie and the brittle were awesome. The molten cake was saved for last and I swear to you I wondered if it was New Year's because this cake was so savory, it had a pleasant hint of black-eye peas in it! I know that may seem gross to read or imagine, but this really works along with the chocolate and cream. Never had anything like it! ------ UPDATE: We've since been back to Sunda a number of times for an early lunch and it hasn't disappointed. Andrea has served us a couple of times and goes out of her way to make us feel comfortable. We are definitely fans of their taro coconut bread pudding made from brioche. The LaVazza coffee is great after a nice glass of Trace Merlot.\",\n",

I expected pork belly but the smokey bacon combined with the salty caramelized sauce made the whole dish a bit too salty and rich for me.

The prices were a little higher than I expected but I feel that the food was well worth it.

       "  \"I have never written a Yelp review, but I feel compelled to do so this evening because of the SHEER DISAPPOINTMENT with my meal at Bon Soiiree. I have been 4 times and, before tonight, it was my favorite Chicago restaurant (fun, small, BYOB, etc.), but this evening's meal was really a sad state of affairs. From bland and overcooked dumpling (tasted like something frozen from Trader Joes), to very dry and uninspired pound cake, it felt like paying $75 for something that was worth $15. To be fair, as I noted, I loved them in the past. All I can say now is that I sincerely hope the restaurant reads this review and comes up with a menu that is more creative and more worthy of the high price, especially since most of us go for a special occasion. It really was bad enough that I will never be going back. I wasn't even full after the 7 course meal... For those of you on the fence, I hope you at least wait until the menu changes because the current menu is not worth the high price. What a bummer- take a look at all the recent review, mostly terrible. Not worthy of a Michelin star...\",\n",

I wasn't as big a fan of whatever chicken we had (something less tomato-saucy and more olive-oil based, though I never heard exactly what it was). The bread, though, was AMAZING. They had a foccacia that was just absolutely delicious - lots of herbs, cheese, and other tasty seasonings I couldn't even identify. I could have just eaten the bread and drank my wine and been happy... All in all, good if pretty standard Italian.

This is the place to go when you have a group with diverse tastes!The service was excellent. The owner, Janet, made special arrangements to accommodate our large group and also was sensitive to the other guests; we were seated in the upper section and somewhat separated until the restaurant got busy. We had a guy for our server (can't remember his name) and he was very attentive.Finally the ambiance was perfect for our needs.

After speaking to our server she suggested the scallops from the small plate menu, which turned out to be chewy. The scallops were delivered to the table by the restaurant host who then happened to say that our issue was not the first time they had heard this comment and chuckled, saying the chef can be a little heavy handed with the salt.

The other half we had the sauce that is more soy sauce based, which was also tasty, but the BBQ was my favorite. Be prepared to get messy and lick your fingers clean! There was so much chicken we had enough to take some home and enjoy the next day. The fries are good but a little thin for me...think McDonalds.

Cutting to the chase: The blueberry pancakes were really three items in one: pancakes, blueberries, and blueberry cream cheese frosting. The pancakes themselves were among the best around (cue the fight scene from \"The Karate Kid\"). Seriously, they were dense and perfectly browned. The berries were real, fresh, plump and left me wanting a few more, truth be told. The blueberry cream cheese, you ask? I could take it or leave it. Interesting concept, but I dabbed my fork o\\' pancake in the butter more often than the frosting.  I ordered an iced tea, and neither the menu nor our server mentioned it was flavored. Typically, I am a drinker of unsweetened, black tea-stuffs and like to keep it simple. But wait! This tea was flavored with a berry essence and it was good. Very, very good. Have I turned over a new tea leaf? Perhaps. Have I exposed myself as a dork by making a pun? Indeed.  One final note for those of you who need one more push before clicking \"Useful\": Glenn\\'s serves a variety of alcohol, including mimosas, bloody Marys and spiked coffee at breakfast. What they do not serve before 11 AM is beer. Hmmm. I stroke my chin thoughtfully and leave you to consider this double-standard.',\n",

The music was louder than I expected. I know GE billed itself as fine dining but without the haughtiness, but I thought the music was a bit too loud as I felt I needed to speak loudly so my table partner could hear me. However, I did enjoy the atmosphere and the lack of tablecloth was nice for such a place. The waiter tried to sell me way too hard on buying their specialty drinks, as I must have turned him down 3 or 4 times. Sometimes a man just wants a Coke, mmkay? Popcorn was brought out before the entree and I found it to be quite good. The popcorn flavor rotates and we were given the ranch style. Can\\'t speak to the other styles of course. For the entree, I ordered the salmon which was presented very impressively on the plate. I would highly recommend the dish. I normally hate beets, but I even enjoyed these as they had just the right amount of flavor and taste to compliment the other food on the plate. Everything was paired intelligently.I had the Molten Chocolate cake for desert which was even better than the entree. Caramel was added to the side as well as a small \"glass\" filled with a milk shake. Better experienced firsthand than described. Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Graham Elliott but did not come away wowed or disappointed. If you\\'re looking to find a quality establishment at a reasonable price, than GE is definitely for you. If price is not an issue, then the more expensive staples (such as Alinea or Moto) are a better option.',\n",

I did get to experience the rooftop patio and it was really cute up there. The only thing I wasn't too into was the chairs were kind of cheap looking and didn't have quite the same feel as the interior, but then again, this is outdoor furniture. They also had some cushioned benches and gazebo-like booths. Luckily, I went on a Monday and we could get a table. Otherwise, I am sure the weekends are packed! I am sure, too, it is a place to see and be seen. I can see the trendsetters, all dressed up, drinking the pricey drinks. Yes, of course, be prepared to shell out a pretty penny for the fancy (or not so fancy) drinks. I spent more on 2 drinks than I did for a whole meal + wine.

My friend and I go and order a bunch of appetizers and share the rack of lamb and riblets. Forget ordering a big entree, you're better off enjoying a variety of tastey sides rather than filling up on meat and rice. Meats are seasoned to perfection, and every dish is full of Greek goodness. If you're Greek and/or a fan of Greek food: this place reigns supreme. The only downfall is the wine... Not much of a selection and Greek wines are not my personal favorite. Here are my favorite dishes: Taramosalata, Saganaki, Skordalia (get it if you love garlic), Grilled Octopus (be brave, try it and guarantee you'll love it), Keftedakia (tender, tastey, lamb meatballs), Pita Bread (for dipping), Lamb Chops, and Lamb Riblets. (At Greek restaurants, it's encouraged you eat with your hands!) Sounds like a lot, and it is. But you can split this meal with up to 4 people (or have yummy leftovers the next day). Opa!\",\n",

Anyway, we get our little bar coupon and go in the bar and wait. The service is quite good. The waiter was pulling the only open chairs out for us and the restaurant was packed to the gills. We ordered drinks, but the only problem is you don't know how much they are without expressly asking, because you don't get a bill. Instead the waiter writes down a code and it is added into your bill later. Our friends were so late that we had 2 drinks each, so that was $30 added on to our bill.  Not a big deal, I just would rather have paid at the time b/c it would have made splitting the bill easier for others. But I do understand it helps the flow so waiters aren't waiting for people to close up the bar tabs. More of an observation. However next time, we'll show just for desert and we'll end up being on time! The food and meat are terrific. I have been here before like 3 years ago when it first opened, but I think they have all the kinks out. The salad bar is terrific, and huge. Listen to your waiter when he says don't fill up on salad! One drawback I have is how crowded it gets. I just don't like the crowds and the noise. But that's just me searching for something wrong. It's $48.95 for each meal, but you get well more than you pay for, so be prepared to eat. Not a good date place in my opinion because you might not look too refined pigging out.

The place was quite full, but we still managed to find a couple of seats. Seating layout is definitely something we were not too crazy, either. I'm fully aware of the 'street vendors' seating in most Asian countries - but this is a restaurant, so I'd rather not facing a total stranger while I'm sucking on the tip of the chicken wings.  We ordered half-order of chicken wings with Seoul Sassy sauce, and two orders of Seoul Steak Bowls (bulgogi over rice). They are good - but not super good that would make me want to go back next weekend. The Seoul Sassy sauce is the typical Asian sweet & spicy sauce - so I found nothing (too) special about it. I have actually had better bulgogi else where. Next time maybe I should try their bibimbap. Their serving is pretty huge (off of the regular menu, not the lunch special) - so for you with small tummy capacity, you might want to share.\",\n",

I drove from the suburbs on Saturday and figured i pick up instead of waiting since the place was crowded with the young ones drinking. As i drove home i started eating a slice for the road. Well! the dough was chewy, the ends were burnt and there was not enough cheese. What a dissappointment. The pizza was so greasy that after sitting in the car for the drive home it looked so grosse that i ended up throwing it out. After spending $18 for a small pizza ,driving 23 miles to get it . i would not dare put that piece of food in my body. Sorry but it is the truth.Will never be ordering there again.As a matter of fact i should off driven back for a refund.What a waste.',\n",

Service - Very attentive, very courteous, lots of servers and different wait staff helped us, so it got a bit confusing.  Drinks - they made a very good manhattan. They know how to make a drink ok.. FOOD - I\\'ve had waaay better. The salad bar has a decent selection and it was nice that they had Oysters. The rice was wattery and the black beans were flavorless. The fried plantains could have used some sweetness to them. The mashed potatoes.. cold. The meats were pretty bland and tasteless. The only thing that stuck out to me was the broasted chicken. Very tastey and I hardly ever go for the chicken at these places. The top and bottom sirloins were halfway ok, nothing to rave about. They could use a tastier and more flavorful crust. The picanha was so so, again more flavor! it was bland. I am still yet to find one of these restaurants that surpass Texas De Brazil(Schaumburg). Not only is the food and service amazing there but it is even less expensive than the over priced Fogo de Chao and Brazzaz. Waay over priced, I feel I paid too much for the quality food I ate. If you\\'re paying $50 a plate.. it better be damn good, I dont care how much if it your hustling out of the kitchen, if it doesn\\'t taste good it doesn\\'t matter.

This is the Top Notch people. If you are a Foodie, you know how hard it is to get Good Clean Food. Good Clean food as in Chef Curated Products from Farm to Table. This comes at a price. Maybe you don\\'t buy Grass-Fed beef or the like to understand what/who you are supporting. This is something important to me. (Read Omnivore\\'s Dillema or watch Food Inc.-the movie to get the gist) My Husband and I went here with our twin 4 year olds. We put our name down and yes it was a 3 hour wait. BUT, I had read all the Yelp comments and we were prepared. This was our Anniversary celebration. We put our name down, we checked in at 1 1/2 hours to get a pager and we pretty much did stuff nearby till we closed into the 30-45 minute range of our table. It was not a hard wait as you wanted to check out the decor and see what looked good from other orders. My husband got the Duck with Mole(he had to after watching the Top Chef Masters) I got the Saturday Ribs Special (Muy Picante-it should come with some chap stick-But YUM!)I absolutley loved the Savoy cabbage slaw, black beens with maybe Cotija cheese on the side. Kept me cool! I had to take home half the ribs-happily to enjoy the next day! Oi vey! The starter we got was the Chicken taquitos and they were smokey & delicious and the presentation on everything was very beautiful and considerate...right down to the Kale Chips with my husbands Duck. He said it right when he said, \"This is like the level of making Japanese or French food!\" He was right. I just got back from Kyoto and so I had been eating the traditional Japanese food before they had Beef (1853?) and it\\'s very sensitive and detailed. Much like French food, you must be precise or it will not come out right. Everyone LOVES Mexican food, and to refine it with the Ingredients, and edge of Modernity, by being green and Pro-Farmers; Rick Bayless has take Mexican food to the Top!! Chicago people who understand this are so lucky to live near this place. What a gem! I bet he could get a Michelin Star in his future. SUMMER MARGARITA!-Cucmbers!! Gotta get it! PS Wait staff was AWESOME. Water guy kept our glasses filled! My waiter helped me surprise my husband with a dessert that was SUPERB. Best experience. Oh and my kids loved their Queasadillas too! [even his rice is something to write home about-you gotta taste his Mexican rice!] His chips are hand made-you can taste it and he had two mild salsas for us a red and green Tomatillo sauce!(My fave!) Oh and the Price! For Drinks, Starters, Meals and 3 Desserts! Less than $30 a person!! That is AMAZING! It\\'s a bargain for what quality you are getting!',\n",

The waiter seemed indifferent, refused a coupon that was given to my friend by a local merchant-- though that may be the merchant's fault for distributing expired coupons-- and rushed us, asking us how our food was a minute after bringing it to us (we had not even tasted it yet). Then he brought the check before all of us were finished. Okay, message received.All of that would not have upset me, but I developed food poisoning shortly thereafter. I'm not saying that Uncommon Ground definitely gave it to me, but it seems strange that the same night, after eating their salad, I vomited lettuce. I missed two days of work as a result, not to mention the vomiting and other, um, unpleasantness. Again, I don't know if it was directly their fault or the fault of some mystery food that entered my system as I slept, but, to be safe, I'll not be going back.\",\n",

The food did remind me of the year I lived in Italy.... much more Italian than the american-italian food some many of us get used to eat. Unfortunately nothing really stood out. The grilled calamari was good, but over priced. We had a couple of the pastas -- good but not great. I had the short rib and it was decent, but ended up being disappointing because it had been so highly recommended. I'm looking forward to going back this summer when the outside back patio is open...

The decor very old-school but charming. They had small trellises set up around 2-seater booths with lights strung through and around. Glass display cases separated the small dining rooms and were filled with random little glass figurines. It was pretty empty around 12:30 but had a nice sized crowd by the time we left around 1:45. A lot of regulars which is always a sign of either good food or bargain prices. Both of which I am a fan of! The waiter didn't miss a beat. He had everything ready to go for us knowing we were in a bit of a time crunch. We split the crab and avocado salad which was an interesting combination I had never had before. Not bad! Not bad, at all. They didn't skimp on the minestrone. It was very thick (it probably didn't help that I added a couple spoonfuls of Parmesan) & I'm not gonna lie, I was sad to see it go but had to save room for the entree! We also split the bow tie pasta with peas, sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pretty average, nothing spectacular but a good side if you're going family-style. In typical dad fashion, he wouldn't let me leave without having a slice of tiramisu and a capuccino. Mm mmm! I'll definitely stop in again if I'm in the area.\",\n",

When responding to my question \"is there a place to check my coat,\" the appropriate response is usually NOT \"no, but I can bunch it up and put it behind the hostess stand.\" Seriously? Is this Chicago? Are the temps cold in the winter? Is this restaurant in one of the nicer hotels on Michigan Ave.? There was no chance I wanted our coats bunched up like that, so I opted to keep them, a decision I would soon regret.  Good grief, could you be sitting any closer to the table next to you? How many people are you trying to cram in the restaurant? It was virtually impossible for anyone to enter the booth areas without completely disrupting the dining experience of the adjacent tables. The waiter had to stand behind the table and shout across to the people in the booths because there was no room. Oh, and those jackets that everyone had with them because they could not check them, where do you think they ended up? On the floor, on the dinners next to them, under butts like a booster seat.....  We went to this restaurant because they advertise \"Iron Chef Mondays\" on the website. It\\'s still listed there as a type this. This special offers the tasting menu for $35. Well according to our waiter, \"we haven\\'t done that in a while (while laughing).\" Well, then take it off your website!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can\\'t imagine we were the only people there interested in that. The waiter was selling us on the tasting menus, so we obliged and got the wine pairing for each (1 basic and 1 \"premium\" tasting menu). Unfortunately, the \"chef won\\'t mix the normal and premium tasting menus at the same table.\" Not sure why. If I was dining alone could I still order a single tasting menu? If the answer is yes, you can mix and match the two tasting menus at a table with multiple people. Are all the single diners in the restaurant on the night we were there not permitted to order off the tasting menu? There were the same amount of courses on each tasting, so it\\'s a bit perplexing.  The quality of the food was, at best, average. While appealing to the eye, the taste was just not there. Many of the initial tapas dishes were loaded up with way too much bread and lacked any remarkable flavor. It wasn\\'t by any means disgusting, it just wasn\\'t very good. The two better items on the menu were the short rib flatbread and the garlic shrimp. Hindsight, I\\'d probably get those as my meal if I went back. Overall, for nearly $250 (two basic tastings, basic wine pairing, tax, and tip) it was not worth it. There are many other tapas places in town that are just as a good (if not better) for a fraction of the price. Hindsight, I should have used the $1.99 Sangria special after checking in on FourSqaure (unless they haven\\'t done that in a while).',\n",

It's not exactly cheap, but not unreasonable either. It's all about perspective. A top chef meal for 2 under $50? Sounds like a deal to me. Cubano: pork loin, bacon,cheese, beans & avocado? Delishness. Ahogado: either they messed up and gave me the spicy or the medium is really spicy! I grew up on hot sauce & kimchi, but found myself wimping out on the spicy broth. Chips/guac/salsas: pretty good, but I would love if they would offer some papas fritas churro: $1.25 each or 3 for $3 It's worth trying $47 for the cubano, ahodaga, chips/guac/salsas, beer, wine, chocolate con leche, and a churro.

MUCH easier, never need a reservation. I do plan on sitting in the main area, one of these days. I've heard so much about this place so I had high expectations. Most of the food was pretty good. I like the whole small portions idea, everyone gets a little bit of everything. What I was displeased with was the drink I ordered. I ordered a very simple drink, dirty martini on the rocks, extra dirty. I sent it back twice because all I could taste was vodka. My girlfriend ordered a drink from their drink list and that turned out pretty good. Overall, I was satisfied with the two times I've been there.

All the previous reviews are right, the dude behind the counter is super nice. Since it was my first time, he suggested the BBQ and Sassy. I said I wanted plain and Sassy. So he let me tried a taste of the BBQ sauce. He said that I should get the BBQ and Sassy and if I don't like it, bring it back and he'll give me a whole Plain for my trouble. Can't argue with that logic.  Both the BBQ and Sassy are delicious, tasty, and addicting! I've not tasted such flavors and crispiness in fried chicken before. Ever! It's like my eyes have been opened to the truth in Fried Chicken. Hallelujah!!! The side of Kimchi is yummy too! Sour, crispy, spicy fermented cabbage!!! That mixed in with fried chicken just works for me. Love it!! Everyone, buy stock in chicken farms bc I will be back to Crisp for more chicken!!\",\n",

       "  'WARNING: This is going to be a long review! So here are some quick notes. Come here, no questions asked. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, JLT with Fried Egg and Meatball sliders were my favorite. Awesome service! I have been excited to try the Purple Pig since I\\'ve first heard about it. I\\'ll admit, this is one reason why I wanted to come to Chicago in the first place, that\\'s how much I love food. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I stopped by around 5:30, which ended up being about 30 minute wait, not bad for how busy this place was. I didn\\'t know what to expect walking into the doors but the atmosphere I experienced was absolutely AMAZING! This is not a fine dining establishment, but the food is definitely on par with any high priced restaurant. The atmosphere is loud and crowded but very fun.  The staff is VERY Friendly which is always welcomed. They have a waitress to takes your orders and then they have other individuals who refill your waters and serves your food. It works well, except they tried to give me a dish I didn\\'t order and charge me for it...that was fixed though, no complaints. The FOOOOOOD!!! -Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: I\\'ve heard a lot about bone marrow and this is my first experience with it. The bone marrow was extremely rich and the capers and herbs went very well with the spread. I tried the bone marrow alone, with the bread and then with the bread and herbs. I definitely think the herbs brought out a great flavor because it helped cut the richness of the bone marrow and it just gave more substance to the dish. Maybe I\\'m just a bone marrow amateur. -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: OMG!! This was absolutely amazing! I wish I ordered two of these! The pork shoulder was extremely tender and gravy was just wonderful. Chewing threw the pork, you really get the essence of a dairy/milky flavor which was very subtle made this dish fantastic! The mashed potatoes are mashed potatoes, nothing special there but it helped get me and my friend full. -Prosciutto Bread Balls: This was our first dish and I can\\'t say I was a fan of this so much. Probably cause I was expecting something different. It was a lot more herby than I expected and I couldn\\'t quite figure out what was in it, herb wise. -\"JLT\" with Fried Egg: This was my favorite dish! The main reason why I ordered this dish is because I thought, pork and a fried egg together?! How is that not a win?  The flavors on this dish were exquisite! I expected something more rich because of the egg, but the lettuce was tossed with a very citrus-based dress that made the dish extremely refreshing and light even with the egg on top. Although, the jowl (pork cheek) didn\\'t stand out as much it rounded off the sandwich, if you can call it that, very well. The balance in this dish was absolutely perfect, I\\'m drooling thinking about this as we speak. -Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli: I only had one piece of this, but the scallop was cooked perfectly. To me, as long as you cook the scallop properly you don\\'t need to add much to make it good. It was a good dish, just doesn\\'t stand out to me compared to the other stuff I had. -Razor Clams with Oregano, Lemon & Olive Oil: This is my first experience with razor clams and I was very pleased. By the name of this dish you can tell it\\'s very simple with the overall emphasis on the clams. They felt and tasted a lot like a scallop to me and I liked it. Nothing fancy here, just well executed. -Meatball Sliders: I love meatball sandwiches! With that said, I picked up my slider took a bite and was in heaven! The meatball was moist and perfectly cooked. The bread was soft, NOT soggy, and had great flavor, it was served on a brioche bun. Maybe I\\'m biased towards a meatball sandwich but this was a great item. Overall, my experience with The Purple Pig was fantastic! Yes the portions are small, but it just allows you to share with your friends and try out a lot of things on the menu, which I\\'m glad I got to do. My suggestion is order the whole menu if you can!',\n",

I have come several times for lunch and dinner and have sampled many of the dishes (we like to share) and this stuff is phenomenal!  From the bone marrow to the beef fat fries to the welsh rarebit on to the wild boar sloppy joe then the deconstructed rabbit pot pie, and on and on. The cocktails are great but their beer selection is snobby. I prefer premium lagers and pilsners to ipas and ipas and ipas. Theirs more to beer than just hops. The wine list is premium. And that's its problem. Too premium. The atmosphere is totally current Logan Square hipster, but I don't mind. I'll keep coming back for the food. But I'll keep coming back for the food.\",\n",

Marc(or was it Mark??) was our server last night. He was very knowledgeable and attentive. He was VERY helpful in helping my heat sensitive husband select the perfect entree,the Churrasco. He loved his steak. I would have loved to have tried some of the mouth watering Ceviches..but...hubby was not feeling very adventurous,so we split the Guac. It was delicious. I had the seared Ahi Tuna....like butter,it was.Melted in my mouth. The side of Plantains...heavenly!

       "  \"I've been here a few times and every time, it's been great. The most recent visit was last week. There were four of us catching up (one of us was from out of town). We got there about 7 on a Thursday night and it was really busy. We had to wait for a four person table to open up. A couple groups of two went in while we waited, but the hostess was trying to figure something out for us. She created a kind of makeshift table for four at two of the high backed chairs, pulling up two stools for us to sit. About ten minutes later, a booth opened up, and we were promptly moved to be more comfortable. Much appreciated. The decor/ambiance is great. Very hip. There are dark, thick, textured curtains, tall-backed chairs, and lighting is dim. We saw a lot of dates happening that night. The best part of all is definitely the drinks. The menu is arranged by liqueur choice - gin, vodka, brandy, rum, tequila, etc. You really can't go wrong with any of the choices. My personal favorites from the night were: 1. Juliet & Romeo. A refreshing mix of Beefeater gin, mint, cucumber, and rose water. This may just be my favorite cocktail of all time. 2. Blue Ridge Manhattan. If you like whiskey, you'll love this drink. 3. Poor Liza. This one tastes like an alcoholic pear. Much better than a pear martini. I don't think they take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you go. But, it's worth the wait.\",\n",

It was more precautionary but tables were filling up around us left and right. The atmosphere is so relaxed and comfortable, with dimmed globe lights and candles adding to the warm glow. Unique and creative artwork on the walls. The service was great, host seated us quickly and the waitress was right there for drink orders. We tried the edamame which was salty and delicious although it never fails that I squirt myself in the face while eating it. There is so much to choose from on the sushi menu, we were out for maki and it was hard to chose just a few!. They all sound delicious. We didn't order anything too crazy; the Santa Fe, Philadelphia, Summer Passion, and the Sunny Crunchy upon a recommendation from our waitress, which was amazing and our order was up very quickly.

My one tiny gripe, some of the rolls are so big they are hard to wrangle with chopsticks and fit into your mouth without them falling apart. Luckily my friend is kind enough not to laugh at my efforts and neither of us have any shame in using our fingers from time to time. I will be back to Indie for sure!\",\n",

About 15 minutes after ordering our food our coffee was gone and we were hoping our waitress or someone would come and fill it up again. 10 more minutes passed and we had to flag someone down to get more coffee. When I noticed that 30 minutes had passed since we'd ordered our food I started to get annoyed...it wasn't too crazy in there or anything and I was starving. Then our food came and bliss was restored. This was seriously the best crab benedict I have ever had the pleaure of eating. Every bite was worth the wait and it will be hard to ever order something else off of this brunch menu knowing how great the benedict is. We also ordered the swan creek pork belly blt and that was really good as well. I loved the tomato fennel jam and the flavor of the pork belly. It was an excellent twist on a classic. All in all it was a wonderful brunch and our waitress was really quick with getting us our bill when it came time to pay.

We ordered: Loompya (a clever re-spelling of the classic lumpia). Perfectly formed eggrolls, with a savory green vinegar sauce unlike anything I've paired with this Filipino standby. Crispy pata, the giant fried pork shank. This came out delicious and juicy. It was also fun seeing a giant shank sitting on the table. Adobo pork belly. I've never seen pork belly used in adobo, and after eating this, I want to see it much more often. Adobo is such a versatile Filipino food, and in this dish it was the meat that made it. Protip: White rice isn't included with the dishes, but you can order it for a couple bucks. They brought us several bowls and only charged us for one order. Nice! Eventually, the general manager came by and admired our Filipino spread. He brought us some off-the-menu sisig, which was so mind-blowing I almost broke down in tears. My roommate was even impressed when he tried the leftovers the next morning. The executive chef here is Filipino, and I've heard stories of there being other off-the-menu specials, depending on what ingredients he has. I definitely recommend inquiring about them. I'm ecstatic to find a place willing to bring Filipino cuisine up to a new level. It wasn't even too pricey, coming out to about $50 a person including tip and drinks. I wish Sunda the best of luck, and hope all you Yelpers give the Filipino dishes a whirl sometime!\",\n",

       "  \"From my daughter's point of viewTwo days ago, for my food expedition that I'm going on with my dad, I went to Tank Noodle. Tank Noodle is a Vietnamese restaurant in uptown. I'm 9 years old and I am a little picky with food, especially spicy food. Remember I'm only nine years old so adults are probably going to like this food. When I walked in the room I took a look around the restaurant and there wasn't really anything very interesting about it. One thing I do like about it is that there are many different cultures and I heard all these different languages. But there wasn't anybody to seat us, maybe the host was just busy or something. They need to make it more interesting and color the walls or something. So I don't really like how it looks but now I'll tell you about the food. My dad ordered for me, he ordered Pho Tai. But first we got this tea that I thought looked liked pee. And guess what? It didn't taste good at all. It might have tasted like pee but, fortunately, I don't know what pee taste like. I did not like it at all. Then our soup came I was a little nervous but when I tried it, it tasted pretty good I have to say. But the noodles were rice noodles instead of egg noodles. My dad's broth was so much better than mine. It tasted almost minty in some ways. It was a seafood broth. Then I tried the bean sprouts and they were not too bad I have to say. That concludes my review for today.     Stella\",\n",

Anyways, I barely looked at the menu and decided on the $19.99 combo deal. This came with a whole fried chicken, in 2 different sauces, with 2 sides, and 2 drinks. Pretty sweet deal. The chicken had a nice crunch, which stayed crispy while covered in sauce, and the chicken was juicy. The Seoul Sassy sauce was sweet and ginger-garlicky. It's not your typical Korean wing sauce, but it was still tasty. The Crisp BBQ sauce was good with a nice kick. The fries weren't anything special, but the fried mushrooms were great.  They also have chicken strips as well as varioius Korean style rice bowls. I love me some Korean fried chicken and Crisp definitely satisified. I still wonder if that Gizzard Blizzard was for real.\",\n",

       "  'My girlfriend and I had to wait a half an hour to get in. We watched several people who showed up after us get seated first. The premise the restaurant is set upon is a jail theme with heavy metal music playing constantly (and loudly). There are something like 13 TVs set up in the restaurant and all of them play a slide show that would be put to better use as a 14 year old\\'s screen saver. Some of the slides include pictures that may put off your appetite, such as stills of singers spitting. The atmosphere seems a little insincere considering the restaurant is full of hipsters, who probably couldn\\'t name any of the songs they listened to whilst dining. The staff is metal though, our waitress proved it by dressing ridiculously (mesh shirt with a bikini top, personally I prefer my servers to appear clean). After getting our waters and order we did not see her again for around 25 minutes, so my girlfriend could finally order a beer. I asked if she had an idea of how much longer our food would be. Instead of offering a \"I\\'m not sure, but I could find out for you\" or a \"I\\'m sorry for the wait\" instead she said, condescendingly, \"Look, it\\'s half off burger day and everybody\\'s here...\" at which point I cut her off to restate that I simply wished to have an idea when I might get to eat.  Twenty minutes later we finally got our food, which was cold and both of our burgers overcooked. The waitress forgot some sides we ordered, I mean how could she possibly remember when it was over an hour ago that we had ordered our food. The food was decent but it would have been better had it been served hot.Long story short, horrible service, irritating atmosphere and decent food. I would not suggest it to anyone and I certainly won\\'t go back. There are too many good burger joints in Chicago to waste your time on this one.',\n",

The mashed potatoes must have heavy cream in them. The pita is dipped in butter and grilled. These Brazilians know their fats, and they know how to use them. The awesome people at Fogo sent me these corrections: 'As far as the chicken and sides, here is some info for you. We use milk in the potatoes, just made fresh twice a day. And we don't do anything to the pitas but just grill them with the chicken when the order is placed. The marinade from the chicken (we throw the pita on top) adds some flavor to the pita.

Not only was I seated one hour after my reservation time, multiple parties who arrived well after I did were seated before my table. This is clearly a place where if you don't know someone expect to be ignored. Our waiter was extremely rude, acting annoyed when he made the frustrating mistake of bringing a glass of wine instead of the bottle I clearly ordered. The cold, unfriendly service made me feel very unwelcome and contributed to the overall negative experience we had. The food is absolutely forgettable- the peaches in my antipasti were rock hard and tasteless (when there is so much great produce in the summer it shouldn't be so hard to create a good dish!). The pork was terrible as the prosciutto was so overcooked it was more like burnt jerky than anything else. Again, dessert was disappointing and not work staying for. And for all those that rave about the patio, yes it is nice to have an outdoor space with some trees, but the experience is ruined when you are crammed in so tight that you can't even move. I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this meal all summer. You are far better off going to 'A Tavola' nearby. Great patio and the food is infinitely better!\",\n",

Oh and btw, the pizza in NYC I had will remain in the bottom 5 of pizzas I have had of all time. Not what I expected at all! =/ That being said, this pizza is so unique but so good and delicious at the same time. Yes, it does take about 45 minutes for them to make your pie but I would rather wait 45 minutes than wait 10 for some pre-made pie thats sitting under a warmer. At leas you know your getting a fresh made-to-order pie! Just plan ahead or order an appetizer to tie you over. We ordered the sausage pie which had a complete payer of sausage covering the pie (the use a ball of sausage and flatten it into a disc which covers every inch of the pie, an absolute dream for meat lovers). The sauce, cheese, and tons of sausage went perfectly together and then the super buttery crust was the perfect support for the massive amounts of toppings. Definitely a knife n fork pie that will fill you way up with just 1-2 pieces. FYI, you can write your name on the walls so bring some white out or a pen that will show up on black booths/walls. So if your in Chicago get some deep dish at Gino's and not Lou Malnatis because I went there too and it was NOTHING compared to Gino's. Enjoy!\",\n",

It took about 15 extra minutes (only complaint) but we finally got our extra large, deep dish, cheese with green peppers pizza. It smelt and tasted absolutely decadent.

Further, there is enough variety to keep things interesting. The salad bar is also great, although I refrained from consuming too much vegetation, the focus is really on the meat, as it should be. Finally, the atmosphere is energetic and fun. It is a great place to go in a group. Overall I did have a great time and I would go back, however, the quality of the steaks was simply not top notch.

The service was amazing - they strike the perfect balance between being attentive and trying to meet your every need and expectation without somehow smothering and hovering over you. Although, maybe waiting for me to get out of the bathroom to push in my chair was a bit embarrassing. Especially, since I was sidetracked by the Alinea book on my way out. Also as a note to servers: don\\'t get irritated with a customer because they didn\\'t tell you they don\\'t like X when you specifically ask \"Are you allergic to anything?\" How was I supposed to know you wanted to hear about my recent campaign to stop the disgusting overuse of truffle in, on, and around everything in Chicago? I don\\'t use \"allergies\" as an excuse. So how about asking if I have any dislikes or preferences? Food - to be perfectly honest I was rather disappointed. I was happy I had had the \"Alinea Experience\" but was rather unimpressed with the food. There seemed to be far too much of the same textures (aka mushy squares and gelatin squares). The only dishes I would say were good were the pork belly, the bacon - sweet potato -mustard (served as a threesome) and the desserts. I did also enjoy the cauliflower which I almost hesitate to mention since me liking veggies means the rest or your food must be.... Wine - Oh my goodness. Amazing. What I craved after my dinner at Alinea was to come back for a night of fantastic wine, baskets and baskets of the amazing bread, \"donuts,\" rolls and cheeses as unique as your wine. Now that would be a perfect 5 stars.',\n",

I'm not sure, but it seemed like everyone who worked there was Greek. The food tasted as authentic as my poor Asian American taste buds could tell. The service was pretty good. The waiter was very jovial, but for some odd reason, he always spoke to my boyfriend and ignored me. I don't know if it was some kind of cultural thing where men don't address women as directly, but it was odd. I didn't really care though. I was there to eat, not bond with strangers. I can't quite remember what we ordered anymore since it was over Christmas, but I do remember that EVERYTHING was amazingly delicious!

       "  'My husband and I went during the middle of the week. The meal started with cornbread and honey butter. It was seriously missing salt. And the corn bread wasn\\'t anything special. I ordered the \"chicken and dumplings\" ($21) The chicken was almost perfectly cooked, I say almost because it was slightly dry, but it was still very tasty. It was served atop some undercooked lima beans, some perfectly cooked carrots and shitake mushrooms. The dumplings, however, were horrible! Both tasted burned and were gummy and flavorless. Yuck! I was very lucky that my husband let me have one of his cheddar biscuits, which though good, also needed salt and wasn\\'t competely cooked through. My husband ordered the pork shoulder ($16), which came on a cute plate with cole slaw, two HUGE cheddar biscuits, and fried okra. The fried okra was perfectly done. And he said the pork tasted \\'North Carolina style\\' and really liked it. Though we liked our meal, we couldn\\'t say we loved it. And in Chicago, that means we won\\'t be back again when there are so many other places where we could spend this money (Sepia).  I was excited to see the dessert menu, expecting there to be something with peaches. Nope. Not even an apple dessert. I understand these fruits may be out of season, but still.... peach ice cream? Something! So we didn\\'t have any dessert. Overall, it was just OK. Won\\'t be back.',\n",

Furthermore, the place was noisy as heck like the New York Stock Exchange with less intelligent people. The woman was laughing hysterically and stomping on the floor at some lame joke. I attribute that perhaps to her drunkeness? Let's hope.The food was also disappointing. It was more vietnamese than French and I've eaten better food at a noodle shop in Chinatown. Everything was mediocre. My entre, the salmon with vermicelli was filled with too much lettuce and fillers without much actual noodles. The deserts were also mediocre. I've tasted better things at the local bakery. All in all, I wouldn't go back here.

When it finally went on the real estate market, he couldn't decide which of the other two he should close. So he closed neither. I had the steak burrito this time (carry out). The burrito was savory. I used the green sauce in it, which was not as fiery as I expected. [Check me here - the red sauce {salsa rojo} is typically the milder, and the green sauce {salsa verdÃ©} is the hotter?]. I requested tomatoes be omitted. They were. The burrito's size was average. There is a bigger burrito you can order should you want more. This La Pasadita gets a solid four-star rating, edging up to 4 1/2 stars. To get up to five stars, it would probably have to make the bigger burrito the one you should order (such that the smaller 'regular' burrito was not as good a value for the money).

The gourmet toppings on the sausages are ridiculous; excellent quality and they know what works with what! simply put the wait in line is def. worth the trip.

       "  'First of all, let me start off by saying that I waited and waited to write this review. I was mostly waiting from a response to the email I wrote to one of the owners after my WRETCHED horrible service experience in this place.  Before I go into detail, let me say that the food was very good. And that I HATE having had such a BIG bad experience at a place that\\'s doing the right thing regarding food, buying local, regional, etc. But I just can\\'t let this pass. And the ONLY reason I give this place two stars is because the food was good, other than that, I give them ZERO for service. My family and I had a reservation for Sunday 2/11 at 1:45 pm. I didn\\'t even mind the wait or the cluster fuck that is the front entrance. Not at all. We were seated after a short wait, and then the waiting began!! We waited for TWENTY minutes before anyone even came by our table with waters. NOT the waitron...a bus person. Ok, fine... Our waiter eventually came by and greeted us by simply asking \"do you have any questions about the menu?\". I quickly told him we needed two coffees, a cocktail, and a biscuit thing. Away he went, showing up ten minutes later with coffee, no cream...the cocktail came ten minutes after that..and then the biscuits. He never once asked my kids if they wanted drinks, nor my spouse, always rushing off. Then there were the blank stares, confused brow furrowing glares, and an apparent general lack of organization of the rest of the staff. Some guy, who appeared to be the manager, was scurrying back and forth between two tables and the kitchen (?) carrying one thing at a time. Cream came, after my coffee was lukewarm, and about an hour later, drinks for my spouse and the kids. Honest to god. I\\'m not making this up. All along, our shit ass waiter, Jazzypants, had a total devil may care attitude and a \\'fuck you\\' kinda grin only befitting of some smarmy asshole who does a job he feels to be beneath him. He probably wants to be an actor, or something far more important than a server. I did suggest in my letter that he should perhaps be released into the wilds of the city to explore other possibilities than waiting on annoying customers, like me...and you...and all of us. Hopefully, if I ever return to BJ\\'s, he wont be there. The service continued as such for two hours and twenty five minutes. My whole day was wasted. And I have a big ball of regret stuck in my gullet for wasting a hundred bucks on a brunch I\\'ll always remember as one of the worst I\\'ve ever had. Left me with a big jones for some simple, decent service. Ughhhh!!!!!',\n",

It started out great because my companion was very knowledgeable about asian food and I was learning new ways to enjoy it.Then my friend removed something from his Pho bowl and put it in a napkin and waved the waiter over. It was a cockroach.The waiter took the roach and the bowl away and said he would get a fresh bowl for my friend. My friend had lost his appetite and refused another. The waiter returned to say that we would not have to pay for that bowl of pho. No real effort was made to express concern or an apology.I could not finish my own bowl of pho, or even the spring roll that had been so delicious a few minutes earlier.We asked for our check and I was very surprised to see that we had been charged, as the waiter promised, for everything except the roach tainted bowl of pho.We guessed that the waiter did not even call the incident to the attention of his manager. Hopefully this review will find it's way to someone at Pho Xe Tang who cares about their customers.\",\n",

       "  \"Based on some good online reviews my two friends and I decided to try this place out on Saturday night. We walked into a small dark place, with one wall being a huge screen that was showing anime the whole time. It was a bit crowded for a Saturday night but there was an open table - we had to wait over 5 minutes for one of the two waitresses working that night to come out from behind the counter wall to seat us. Once we were seated we had trouble reading the menus with the very dim lighting - I'd suggest they reprint their menus (without the black background and 4 point tiny gray font). Once the waitress came back to our table to actually take our order (at least 10 minutes after we sat down) things got better. We ordered miso soup and edamame which came out relatively quickly. The miso was excellent and just hot enough to enjoy. Edamame was standard, but that's hard to mess up. They brought us two buckets of ice for our two bottles of wine - unfortunately we had just bought them, so not enough time to chill. Suggest you bring chilled wine... We ordered 4 rolls which were amazing: Spicy tuna, Reg Dragon, Double Stack, and Spider Roll. All were fantastic. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area to try more rolls.  Funny that someone below mentioned they had no ice...by the end of our meal they ran out of ice too! Pros: Great rolls & not too expensive Cons: Inconsistent service (once at your table they were nice though) & weird atmosphere\",\n",

I\\'m living in NYC right now, so I think my standards for a \"good\" brunch are pretty high since we have way more brunch places than Chicago does. Yolk has a pretty standard menu. Nothing that knocks my socks off. It\\'s clean. Service is fast and courteous. I went once during the Sunday morning prime brunch time. Even though we were late for our reservation, they still managed to get us a table in a timely fashion. I went during low-peak times the following two times and had no trouble getting a table or getting served super-fast. The food is good but not extraordinary. I\\'ve had the chocolate chip/strawberry pancakes. They were mediocre. During that visit, one of my friends got the Hey Ricky omelette. It was really good - must have been the chorizo. If you want a omelette, I highly recommend it. My other girlfriend decided to act healthy in front of us and got the Ironman egg white omelette. Bad choice if you\\'re starving and want some flavor. I\\'ve also tried the Belgian waffles and French toast. Breakfast classics that they seem to have perfected. I\\'ve giving this place 3 stars relative to its location, competition, service, and food. I still prefer it to the sickingly sweet Bongo Room.',\n",

       "  'I have long worshipped at the sacred altar of Bayless. With reverential care, I view my edition of \"Rick Bayless\\'s Mexican Kitchen\" as my dogeared, sauce splattered dinner party Bible, which has sated many a palate. Chicago owes him a great debt for contributing to the establishment of the city as a premier dining Mecca. The world at large owes him heaps for shattering the concept that \"Mexican\" is simply interchangeable with Taco Bell, football sized tacos and Tex-Mex fajitas, and proving it instead to be one of the most diverse, rich and historical cuisines around. Sure he\\'s a Gringo, but he\\'s done the legwork. While I\\'m happy for his recent Top Chef Masters win, it troubles me the way the Food Network makes movie stars out of chefs. I am unconvinced that the endlessly long lines here at Xoco are primarily driven by a need for authentic Mexican street fare. The frenzied riot gathering on Clark Street seems instead to be in line for a Brad Pitt sighting, or a Johnny Depp premiere. That said, while I have enjoyed my several visits to Xoco, having eaten authentic Mexican street fare a great many times, I think Bayless is doing himself a disservice referring to the grub here as that. The offerings here are certainly inspired by, and share names with, the food widely available in their delicious natural state in Mexican markets and bus-stops but frankly can never hope to be so ephemeral. Poshified ingredients, tamed spice, and an easy hand of chiles hamper as opposed to elevate; and I find myself wanting more. But, I still have to hand it to the man... when people leave here having tasted something new and interesting, and can view \"Mexican\" as culinary brilliance for the first time, as opposed to a tepid cuisine of hard-shell tacos, he is doing his job and spreading the Gospel. Amen to that.',\n",

For the appetizer, I got the combo platter which consisted of plantain chips (which were boring), cochettes with chicken and ham and beef empanadas. The cochettes were good, however I asked if they could do chicken and they said no as they were pre-made which just gave it a bad start. They still tasted ok, but they weren't outstanding. For dinner I ordered the ropa vieja. It was boring. Very little flavor, no peppers or onions and was chewy. It did come with rice and plantains. The plantains were quite good and it's hard to screw up rice. I don't eat beans so I took a pass. For dessert I got the warm pudding- it was really delicious and was the highlight of my meal.

The ingredients that complement the dish are delectable and although it sounds like a cliche to say, there really is an explosion of taste and excitement in your mouth!

Although they might be a little pricey they are definitely worth every dollar because each sip is an alcoholic mix of bliss! -The surroundings and atmosphere is completely original! This place has the swankiest bathrooms I have even been in! The whole building is an amalgamation of incredible design, bright colors, loud artistic expressions. Just being inside the building invigorated me! I wanted to eat, drink, dance, and laugh! This is a GREAT place to bring someone on a date or even just have a fun night out with your friends!-The service is fast, reliable, and personal. I have been here twice and both times our server has been very attentive and met our every need in a timely manner. Not only are the servers well trained but they are amiable and talkative. There is no flaw to this place! Whether you are a Chicagoan or a tourist Carnivale is a MUST SEE! You will NOT regret coming! Tips-*call in advance to make a reservation. Sometimes there is a week or two waiting list. *bring a few extra dollars in your wallet. This place can get a little expensive. The guacamole will be around $10, your main course will be anywhere from $15-25 and drinks are around $10 each. Dessert is amazing too! So i would expect to pay $35-50 per person.\",\n",

       "  'The day had finally come for our dinner at Alinea! I have never tried as hard as I did to get a reservation at ANY restaurant as I did with Alinea. Since they announced they were switching to a Next-like ticketing system, it became an obsession of mine for over a month to check their website and Facebook page every half an hour, eagerly waiting their release of August tickets. Being from out of town, I only had 3 nights that would have worked for my schedule so that made it even harder to secure a reservation. On that fateful afternoon that the tickets were released, I only found out about 15 minutes after they went on sale and they were almost all sold out. I was extremely lucky to snatch up the last available table for 2 for the day that would work for me. Tickets to this restaurant were tougher to get than Justin Bieber concert tickets! (ok bad analogy) The many hours of my life spent religiously checking their website was worth it. It was by far the best dining experience ever. What all the other Yelpers have already said is true. Simply amazing.',\n",

But the atmosphere is very noisy, cramped, and hurried. You have people standing and walking all around you while you eat, shuffling back and forth to let the waitstaff by; and the people waiting are giving diners the evil eye if they are still talking/relaxing after their bill comes. Speaking of the bill, given the interesting dishes and the decent portions, I thought everything was very priced reasonably (except the 8oz glass of orange juice for some reason). The food is definitely worth the wait, especially since you can kill time by walking around the interesting (2nd hand) neighborhood shops.\",\n",

       "  \"I went to Alinea for my birthday on November 8. My overall impression is that while it was a very interesting evening and worth the experience, I wouldn't do it again. There was something about the experience that was slightly sadistic. The insistence by the staff (presumably this is coming from the chef) that so much be eaten a certain way and in a certain order was very controlling. You were punished with dirty looks if you didn't do it the right way. On top of that they played a came of \\xa0guess what this is with several of the dishes and wines. By the end I was purposely giving absurd answers just to see the reaction, which was typically kind of snotty.The point of controlling so much of the dinner seemed to be to craft a particular experience for the whole evening. It was all orchestrated. There was a clear arc and story to it. However, the peak of the experience was in the middle so the final courses, all after the savory courses, were a comparative let down. The sweet courses were a muddle and we left remembering those more than the peak. They were not memorable. I think that was intentional. It seemed they intended the high point to be in the middle, while you are the restaurant, not right before you left and went back to the outside world. Once we finished the last course we ready to leave, but they left us sitting there for a long while. I guess we had been bad.I expected to leave feeling I had been to gastronomic heaven. I left feeling a bit like I had been to the gastronomic equivalent of Club Hell in the Matrix movies. So, if you are in to that sort of thing, go for it.\",\n",

Nothing against the waitstaff, but the food was worse than mediocre, and the prices were extortionist.I ordered the tofu scramble, which came with tortillas, black beans (tasted like they were straight out of a can) and veggie chorizo (again, straight out of the package, by flavor). At one point, I asked for extra corn tortillas. Big mistake. When I got the bill, those two tortillas cost me $2. Seriously? $2 for two corn tortillas? No restaurant has even ever charged me for extra tortillas before, they're so cheap. At Cermak, you could get 40 tortillas for $2... And, speaking of extortion, the bottomless, diner-quality coffee is $3. What if you just want a small coffee? Too bad, you will still pay $3, and there's no decaf available. The tofu scramble itself was pretty terrible. It was tofu and sad, overcooked vegetables, nothing else, no spices, no flavor. I expected the chef at Nana to be a better cook than me, but I was wrong. The menu stated the veggies would be seasonal, and since it's still winter, I assumed that would be stuff that keeps in a cellar (root vegetables, onions) and stuff that can grow in the cold a bit south of here (spinach, chard, other early greens). But no, in mid-March, Nana's idea of a seasonal vegetable is a sad hothouse tomato. So, to sum it up: if you want to be charged $18 plus tip for diner coffee, crappy tofu scramble, canned beans, and two tortillas, Nana is the place for you.\",\n",

The location is about 3/4 of a mile from my residence and so the walk is brief, I am very glad to support the place and delighted something went in after Uncle Calvin\\'s BBQ went under. Never went to Cal\\'s but I know the officers of the law did.I went to 90 Miles just because my neighbor wanted to go. The item that stood out the most was the coffee, I believe it was termed \\'Cortadito\\'. Wow! Great coffee flavor and only $1.50.  I remember thinking, \"This is the best coffee I have tasted in nearly 5 months!\". With this economy and all, I am back to buying pre-ground coffee out of the can. Bitter pill. Bitter pill. I have no sense of design, interior or exterior, but when I went in, I was pretty thrilled. I have not been able to visit the original location on Clybourn, so I don\\'t know if the design is a theme that was brought over from the former. They have done well with the place, and I would imagine dining outside is a bit of a treat as well. As a matter of fact, I just walked past it today, and some customers were doing exactly that while their dog remained tied to the City of Chicago sign outside without any water to drink on a warm day like today for a black furry dog.The staff were all exceedingly aware of the importance of being pleasant and welcoming. This is another point that really made the experience a good one. They treated my neighbor and I well. Very friendly.I think folks should go here for a bite to eat. Support these fine people, keep this fine business in our fine neighborhood. Makes me sad that the pizza joint didn\\'t stick around, the one down just west of the elevated tracks by Milwaukee and Armitage, it is the place with the brilliant red exterior. Keep these local ones around, we don\\'t need any sports bars in the area. Everyone should walk the 3/4 of a mile to go to 90 Miles. They have something going here.

My friends brought me to San Soo knowing that I love to try new ethnic foods and I'm so glad they did! Also I am really glad with someone who knew what they were doing because I would have felt totally lost here my first time.  We were promptly seated at one of the low tables, which seemed really cool at first, but in retrospect was not a good idea for myself because my knee does not allow me to sit cross-legged for long periods of time. My friends knew which meat was the best so we ordered a variety and got the soft shell crab as an appetizer-yum!. Although, you don't really need an appetizer because your meat is served almost immediately. Then they brought out our own personal grill, our meat variety, and 20+ little bowls with all kinds of mysterious contents. Oh and fresh lettuce leaves and rice too (the bowls, rice, and lettuce leaves are included in the price of meat). The mystery content bowls are the real adventure because you really have no idea what you are eating, unless you are a Korean food expert. Then we were pretty much on our own to grill the meat and make lettuce wraps, while also adding mystery ingredients from all the bowls. The grilling is harder than it looks, but luckily the meat is cut pretty thin so it does not cook long, however it does get stuck to the grill often. We must have been struggling because at one point one of the waitresses came up and showed us how to better grill the meat. I definitely appreciated this because it showed us how it's really done, but was not rude or pushy. Have to take off half a star for the smoky smell that goes home with you on your clothes instead of a doggy bag. Also had to take half a star off for the price, you do get a lot of food, but I still thought it was kind of pricey for meat that you cook yourself. The food really was excellent though, and I left feeling stuffed, satisfied, and later that night I dreamed of meat.\",\n",

You\\'ll come back.\" In my head, I was thinking \"Ok, we\\'ll see.\" I ordered their classic dog and a milk shake. Had I not been to Gene and Jude\\'s I would probably have been impressed. The pickled tomato seems to be mentioned a lot on the reviews I\\'ve read on Yelp about this place, but I didn\\'t care for it that much. It was a \"eh... so this is a pickled tomato... pretty cool\" instead of a \"OMG, where have you been all my life oh pickled tomato?!?!\" If I had to blind taste test the shake, I would not have been able to tell it from any other shake at any other place I\\'ve been. And I think the shake here was pretty expensive as far as shakes go too =( So I think back about what that guy in line said, and he probably should have said, \"Everything is good. Solid dogs in the city, though a bit pricey because you\\'re in the city. See ya around kid.\" I have not been back to Superdawg. I think the following points need to be made to justify the discreptancy between the number of stars I\\'m giving and the general average this place is getting on Yelp: 1. Gene and Jude\\'s has a better hotdog in my opinion. It\\'s smaller, but you can order a double dog and get twice the \"snap\". 2. Superdawg has a pickled tomato. Go here if that turns you on. 3. The Superdawg dog is $5 and change. The Gene and Jude\\'s DOUBLE dog is $3 and change. 4. Gene and Jude has better fries. Hands down better fries. Both hands down. Underground hands. In summary, my recommendation is go here if you\\'re around the area and really craving a dog. Their dogs are good and solid. However, if you\\'re out to hunt for the best dogs in Chicago, this is not the place. There are cheaper and better dogs at Gene and Jude\\'s, though that may be a bit of a drive away depending on where you\\'re coming from. Good luck hunting my friends!',\n",

My favorite thing about this place is the lunch special. For such a small price you get so much great, gourmet food! It is also great for dinner. In the evening it is a great atmosphere with soft music and candle-lit tables. The owner, Tuan Nguyen, is always around making sure everything is perfect. You can definitely tell that this restaurant is his passion by the way he takes care of it and takes care of his customers! Once you give this restaurant a try, you will want to go again and again.',\n",

Anyway they have odd hours so call ahead to make sure they will be open when you wanna go. They tend to leave the door unlocked when they are closed for their mid-day change over, and then tell you in a snooty manner that they are closed. One of the waitresses (probably from Michigan) even had the nerve to stick her tongue out at me. Needless to say I am bitter and I'll NEVER set foot in that place again.\",\n",

Maybe it was a case of High Expectations Syndrome---you know when everyone and their grandmothers exclaim \"OMGAH I found the BEST sushi place, you\\'re just going to LOVE IT!!!!\" Then you wait and wait and dream and dream about the lucky day you can pick that piece of heaven up. Time will stand still and it\\'s just you and that maki in the room...you pick up your chopsticks, take a bite, and all of a sudden all seems right in the world. Well, like any normal person that is how I imagined it. And....was pretty underwhelmed. I had the Philly and the Una Q (unagi, cucumber, eel sauce). Both were just ok. I judge my sushi by freshness (of fish, rice, and veggies) and flavor of sauces. Everything was middle ground (nothing was spoiling by any means, but I\\'ve definitely had fresher ingredients). The eel sauce was also nothing standout. Somewhat bland and watered down. One huge pro was the AMBIANCE and DECOR. I absolutely LOVE the dark orange walls with cherry blossoms. =D The very dim lighting, candles, and fairly quiet noise level make it a perfect date spot. Very comfortable, classy booth seats as well. So all in all, GOLD STAR for ambiance and service (our waitress was very friendly and gave us several recommendations). Bronze star or 4th place for the sushi itself. I still prefer SEADOG or even Ukai over Coast. As a few stated, I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to go here again. But for $7 for a roll (aside from signature maki which is about 2x as expensive) it IS a very reasonably priced sushi restaurant and worth going to if you\\'re in the area and in the mood for a semi-classy night.',\n",

Saturday morning, we made our way to the Wicker Park location of The Bongo Room and waited outside patiently for a seat. The sun was shining brightly and our pale faces needed to see the light of day... me especially. After a short wait, we got our seat located at the bar and thus began our flapjack journey. Our waiter was incredibly sweet and accommodating and he even smiled and pretended to laugh along with our witty banter. Friend opted for the Orange-Ricotta hotcakes which were served with fresh strawberries and gingersnap brown sugar butter. Yum! She loved them. I went for something slightly more decadent. When in Rome, am I right? I indulged in White Chocolate & 4 Berry Cheesecake Flapjacks. Ummm yes, please! The pancakes were fluffy and very flavorful. The sauces were in a word... amazing. The berries that topped my pancakes were the freshest berries I've had in a long time.

We ran into the owner on our walk over, who stopped and hugged my friend (both he and his father were regulars). Entering, I was very happy with the fundamentals of the place - the layout, the not-too-bright lighting, the interesting-without-being-distracting background music. The beer special that night was a brew I've never tried (and I've tried many, many). The owner had called ahead - dinner was on her.

We started at their small hidden bar in the back where we chatted until our table was ready and I had a chance to sample their margarita. On the rocks no salt... I was really looking forward to eating, why? I was hungry and this thing they called a margarita was getting my tipsy already. Was it phenomenal? No. Was it doing it's job? Yes. We sat down and his friends who I was sitting by come here quite often, suggested we get the guacamole for our side of the table, I agreed and threw in the nachos. The gauc was smooth and creamy, good, but not awesome, (I like mine a little chunky), the nachos, were again good, but not amazing and the salsa was really good, very fresh. Then I ordered the enchiladas verde, great portion size, very reasonable prices and tasty. I did see someone else get a burrito at the other end of the table.... for once I saw something that no matter how hungry I would ever be, could I even imagine eating the entire thing. The thing was beyond massive, yet looked like a worthy adversary to try and beat. All in all the prices were good, the place was busy, small and quaint, service was friendly and swift and I left just how I like to from a Mexican restaurant... full and tipsy with money still left in my pocket.\",\n",

However, if you want to stick to the classics, you'll find pages of them! On a Saturday evening, we waited about a half hour for a table of six - not too bad and completely worth it.  Note: I also highly recommend the sister restaurant Lao Beijing, just down the street.\",\n",

I would have never guessed you could get that many different flavors in rice, vegetables and mushrooms. It was amazing.  Not too heavy and the flavor was outstanding. My girlfriend loves the kabobs.  The place can get busy and it's a bit awkward waiting for a table as their really is no designated waiting area and you always feel like your standing in someone else's eating space. No one really wants to stand next to a table full of people eating. Overall this place has some of the greatest food I've ever had.\",\n",

It was good but they added so many extra charges that I ended u paying over ten bucks for what is otherwise a pretty simple dish that should never be over eight bucks. My bf and i came here last weekend and decided to try the chicken. YUM! I love me some chicken wings and having the korean twist just made it that much better. I think the sauces are delicious and original and just adds something different. I've had korean styled wings before but I really think CRISP has got the taste down. The seoul sassy is a teriyaki flavored sauce, but it's much more delicious.  My bf ordered the korean bbq and wow, it was so delicious! Honestly, the flavors really impressived me and I left craving more. When I go back, I will be having both the seoul sassy and the korean bbq because I liked switching back and forth between the two flavors. The only thing missing here is some moo, which is a white radish pickled in vinegar that Korean restaurants usually serve with fried food. It cleanses the palate and cuts through the grease. Eating chicken without the Moo was sad for me.. it was like eating sushi without the ginger. If they would only get some moo to go with the chickens, I would add another star!\",\n",

The Vietnamese sandwiches are delicious and filling, come with a fresh sliced orange, and cost....wait for it... $4.50. It's a shame that people regularly spend $6-8 bucks at the nearby sandwich spots for something less tasty. On a cold day, I crave their Pho soup. I have yet to have better Pho anywhere, and I grew up on Argyle. I also enjoy the smoothies. It puzzles me that people have complained they're too sweet. The blend the fruit right in front of you, and without adding any sugars or sweeteners. They're delicious and refreshing.But what's really got me to 'yelp' about this place is the service.

There's something about black, and leather, and velvet, and high-backed chairs, and dim lighting; walking into the Violet Hour is like walking into another world. The ambiance is so enthralling. It's somewhat like a cross between a speakeasy during the times of prohibition, and how I imagine a Vampire's den might be. I've never seen anything else quite like it. As amazing as the Violet Hour looks, I imagine most people go for the drinks, and they do not disappoint. They are expensive, but they'll probably be the best drinks you've ever had. They're really not even drinks, they're more like art. The only thing ordinary about the Violet Hour is the service. I've had varying experiences. Sometimes great, sometimes OK, and sometimes really bad. The worst time, we waited 20 minutes for the waitress to come by, and then another 20 minutes to get our drinks, and that was on a weekday. So it's hit or miss, but still definitely worth it. My only real complaint, is that unfortunately the Violet Hour has become something of a novelty lately. The people that go there don't seem to appreciate it very much, which I find to noticeably detract from the experience. The first time I went it seemed more . . . authentic; there seemed to be a sense of awe in the room. But now it's filled with people who seem to be unaware of how magical it is, and are only interested in the place because it's kind of a secret that other people don't know about.\",\n",

First the outdoor seating; it's completely beautiful and provides the experience as you are eating in a garden in Italy. We had dinner on a cool 70 degree Chicago night. It was gorgeous. The food then hit. We began with the peach salad which is subpar at most. The highlight is the goat cheese that they used. The peaches didn't taste special. It should be the highlight of the dish, but nothing memorable. We then shared two appetizer portions of the black truffle ravioli and black spaghetti. The black truffle was not great. Just because a restaurant uses truffles doesn't elevate the dish, you still have to execute the recipe. However, the black spaghetti was amazing! The sauce and seafood was so amazing! We then split the grilled steak with arugula and grape Tomatoes. This was ok, not amazing and worth $29. We then finished off with the hazelnut chocolate cake which was fantastic! It was a great way to end a decent meal. I wouldn't go back immediately, only if the gf and I are craving black spaghetti and hazelnut chocolate cake.\",\n",

I know the trend is minimalism in menu writing these days, but I was bored. All the more surprising that the shrimp and sea bass curry and the large chicken salad that came out were absolutely creatively presented and wonderful tasting. Fantastic lemongrass flavor with the shrimp and a salad piled high with tinily chopped morsels. The sushi was well sushi; you can't really dress up sashimi and even flying it the speed of sound from the ocean would be too slow.\",\n",

Everyone always enjoys their food, and I finally broke from my tempeh reuban tradition (it's so yummy--it was tough to try something new) and got the Chicago style tofu. I had my doubts I would like it since they have actual veggie hot dogs on the market, but you know what? It was fantastic. If they took reservations, they'd be 5-star. I get why businesses don' want to take them, seeing as many people are inconsiderate & late, but I think it's unreasonable to not even take them for larger parties. I have twice waited an hour for a table with a group of 6 & a group of 8, and another time we came in a group of 6 or 7 and left because the wait time was just too long. It can be a long wait for 2 or 4, but a crazy wait for a larger group. Wouldn't it make life easier on the restaurant, too, if they knew to expect & plan for a large group? If we aren't there on time, give away the res...too bad for us! I'm just not a fan of waiting when I can make a res elsewhere.\",\n",

       "  \"Me and my wife went last night for the first time to Little Bucharest Bistro.Before ordering, the waitress talked to us a little bit and asked a few questions, giving me the impression that she was doing so to know our nationality and that way figure out which menu to give us? It was really confusing, she had like 5 different menus. I bet this was difficult for her since I am latin and my wife Italian. Apparently they have a menu for russians, romanians and other type of nationalities, could this be considered racism? Kind of reminded me when black people weren't allowed in 'white people' restaurants.The host (owner, we think) was very friendly, maybe a little too friendly ...to the point where we didn't know if we had better offer him a chair to sit with us since he liked to talk to us even through our meal. A bit annoying to be honest. Although the description of the place on yelp says ' Noise Level: Quiet' , we found it to be very loud. Live music and the owner throwing-breaking glasses and plates on the flour (like a Greek would do, but we are in Romania?) made it very difficult to enjoy a date with my wife, we almost couldn't hear each other speak.After deciding what we were having for dinner the food started to come out.We shared a 'ceviche' that according to the description on the menu was marinated with cilantro, orange and lime juices... had red pepper confit and was served with pita chips.Now, this ceviche was absolutely out of this world. Probably the best I've had and I am latin, I know about ceviches.For the main course, my wife ordered 'Sarmale' (pork and beef stuffed cabbage rolls, served with creamy polenta and 'creme fraiche') The 'creme fraiche' part made me laugh, they gave us sour cream instead of the french silky-smooth REAL creme fraiche. But ok, them thinking we didn't know about food didn't ruin our night.The stuffed cabbage was really delicious but we thought it was a bit too greasy.I had the short rib goulash. It came with chewey gnocchi (really nothing special) and the 'sauce' was more of a stew-like thing. Was good but it tasted like canned tomatoes to me. Nothing fresh. It was an ok dish.Overall we are not big fans of this place. Funny enough the only thing me and my wife really really liked was the only thing that didn't seem to be 'Romanian' at all.The waitress was excellent, very helpful and friendly. Oh and one last thing that I thought was devastating, with the check came an envelope that suggested we leave a tip for the band playing music. We felt almost offended by this. Very tacky.\",\n",

I was, however, dissapointed at the service, the place was busy with large group and maybe that had someting to do with it, while friendy and smiley it lacked that something that makes service great. A couple of things forgotten in the order, etc just not to par with the food. I definitely recommend it for the food.',\n",

She came oer and said \"oh, sorry, I was holding those seats for them.\" What kind of service is this when even the door hostess told us that it was open seating when we came in and she was even bringing us MENUS to these seats as all this transpired! Shame on the bartender. We turned to the bartender and said that they can have their seats and we would be going somewhere else. The worst part was as we were leaving I turned around as we were walking out, the one guy is shouting obscenities, and the female bartender that I then guessed was friends of his was just laughing as she was serving him drinks.

Yes, I've even heard that Gino's was featured on some Food Network show. And when Gino's happened to be visible from my hotel room with a constant line that went around the corner ... yes, I had to try it. Was waiting in that line worth it? First, I have to say we only waited about 5 minutes because we were a party of two and every other party was sensible enough to come in a pack so they could consume the pizzas and still walk out. If I had to wait longer than that, I'd have been really upset. The key piece of information you need to know before deciding to go there is that it's a cornbread based crust, NOT normal pizza dough. I would have given them 2 stars because I didn't care for the crust at all, but I can't really fault them for making pizza differently than everyone would expect. On the positive side, their sauce is more flavorful than Giordano's. Everything else is about the same; you go to one, you don't need to visit the other. So, I guess conventional wisdom turned out to be right. Pick Gino's or Giordano's for a slice of Chicago style, and then figure out some better places to eat (because Chicago is filled with them).\",\n",

I thought it was much better than the chocolate cake, which the waiter recommended..) As my friend and I were eating our salads, the hostess came over and asked, \"Are your salads tasting alright?\" with a concerned look on her face. At first I thought there was an issue with it, but then I realized that she was just being overly friendly. And then the same thing happened with our entrees: \"Is your food still tasting alright?\" I like good service, but please phrase your questions in a better way!

If the pizza had been hot they would get four stars, or maybe even five. I find it easy to overlook service flaws for great food. My girl and I were visiting from Cleveland and deepish pizza was on our to-do list for the weekend. We found Giordano's here on yelp and were impressed with the reviews. We expected it to be busy and it was. Packed. We walked in around 9 and they said it would be an hour to an hour fifteen to sit. The host guy said something about pre-ordering the pizza, but we weren't in a hurry and the menu said they only take 35 minutes. So we thought we would enjoy a drink and wait for the pizza to bake. Boy, were we ever wrong. When we finally got seated and asked for the pizza the server told us it would be ANOTHER HOUR AND FIFTEEN minutes before the pizza would be out. ...but ...but ...but the menu says 35 minutes. OK, we'll chalk it up as a rookie mistake. No problem, we're still not in a hurry and we waited this long. We REALLY want our deep dish pizza now! So we order zucchini sticks while we wait and they are awesome. They came out super hot and crunchy. ...waiting ...waiting ...waiting ...and FINALLY our pizza arrives. YAY! WE'RE STARVING. First bite... it's not hot. It's not cold, but it's not hot. It does not seem at all like this thing is fresh out of the oven. They didn't bake the thing long enough. So we ask them to put it back in and it comes back out STILL NOT HOT INSIDE. Oh well. It tasted good, but was not at all what it should have been. Sad. Finally, they're getting ready to close around us. Sweeping and everything. BTW, couldn't they clean some other part of the restaurant that was not right next to our table? Anyway, despite the fact that the place is shutting down, we can't find our server to get the check and get out. 3 hours, 6 beers, several chochy employees, one great appetizer, one OK pizza, and about $75 later we were on our way back to the hotel. I doubt we'll be back.\",\n",

Without trying to come off as a snob, I asked the waitress what the code was, and she said Chef Elliot wanted everyone to experience his restaurant. I thought that was nicely put, though it made me wish I had worn my jeans instead of my other, fancier duds. As for the food, there were playful adaptations of a buffalo wing (thigh meat with a zesty buffalo sauce and slaw made of celery root, plus Budweiser foam) and a good risotto made with, of all things, Cheez-Its. Fun and not forced -- I like that kind of imagination. The entrees we had were all good, starting with my lamb and lentil dish that was herby, tender and pretty memorable. Before your meal, the chef served flavored popcorn; on our night, it was \"malt vinegar,\" which only added to the British pub-meets-fine dining feel. Both desserts were tasty, too.

But it's all a little pricey, a little loud, and a little crowded for me. Looks like a fun place to come with a big group, but as a bar, it's a little unmanageable to hang out in (the bar is between the kitchen and restaurant). The idea of a reading room is cool, but it's so loud in there that it's really just mostly for show, I almost never see people sitting up there, reading or no. So, in summary, not bad, but not my kind of place. I guess if you don't mind paying a little more, the food is a bit better than the immediate competition.\",\n",

The menu is very diverse, making it great for a meat-eater or for a pescetarian like myself. Their pasta dishes are very inventive and combine a wide variety of flavors, which I am a huge fan of. We started with the bruschetta topped with fresh mozzarella. Best bruschetta I've ever had, hands down. The bread was perfectly toasted and the tomatoes were ripe and fresh. We then split the pappardelle con pomodoro seco - homemade pappardelle pasta topped with sun-dried tomatoes and a mascarpone cheese sauce. It was out of this world. The homemade pasta was a noticeable difference from dried pasta, and the tartness of the sundried tomatoes with the rich, creaminess of the cheese sauce was perfectly balanced. We were, however, charged an $8 splitting fee to split this dish - I thought was a big over the top. And the best part of it all - it's BYOB so you don't have to deal with being charged 3x shelf price for a bottle of wine! Atmosphere: Besides the obscure location of the restaurant, the atmosphere within is eclectic and interesting. It has a romantic feel, as most tables consisted of couples on dates. It gets very crowded, so be sure to make a reservation in advance.\",\n",

I was a bit disappointed but my husband made it up to me by ordering lobster bisque which was fairly fine and the quantity was ridiculous. it was the size of those ready made puddings you get in the super market. the waiter got my dish and trust me , it looked just like 1/2 a pound instead of a pound. I generally take an hour to eat crabs cause I enjoy it so much..this time it took me only 15 mins to complete it. the taste was so plain, and aweful. the waiter did'nt come to check on us if we liked the dish. I rather pay 17 dollars and eat unlimited crabs at raintree restaurant. when it came to the end, my husband asked the waiter if they had anything special for people celebrating their anniversaries. he gave us some recommendations and we passed on everything. so he gave us a complimentary key lime pie which was good. ( but if you would sit on the bar, that was an included item) The time we spent together was awesome, but the food is not even worth 1 star. our bill in the end for something we did'nt like was 89 dollars. ps: my husband had fish and chipswhich he thought was pretty ok and the fries were yuck.so we went to pick up our car, and it was on the opposite side of the street which also had meter parking for 1.75 dollars. and they charged us 12 dollars for that..I would rate this place a ZERO.just the time we spent together was priceless.The bread they offer is so sour and horrible.ambience - 2/10decor 4/10service 4/10location 6/10value for money 0/10taste 1/10This is my personal experience..I usually don't like writing negative reviews but this one forced me too.before i conclude, My husband almost threw up on the way and had indigestion the whole way and I had a horrible time with my stomach. won't get into more details, you can imagine. so even the food they serve is not fresh.I have eaten crab at several places and the best would be, rain tree, red lobster and joe;s crab shack.I would never visit this place again.\",\n",

       "  'Do you want raw egg in your cocktails? You should. Fantastic cocktails in a fun space. My advice? Go during the week or early on the weekends. We waited inside the first, non-descript first door for about 45 minutes, even though there were only 4-5 people in front of us. Also, the crowd got a little riled up about who was here first, etc. and made the tight space even more uncomfortable. Once we got past the magic curtain, though, it was happy times. I had the Short Bus drink to start which was velvety and sweet with the richness of egg yolks pretty much rocking my gin-soaked world that night. On the lighter side of the egg, I opted for the gilded cage as my second, clear-liquor drink and LOVED the frothiness of the egg white and spices sprinkled on top, reminding me of a lighter version of egg nog. I sipped some of a few other drinks, but the only other one that really stayed with me was El Diablo. It\\'s basically a margarita taste, but the best margarita you\\'ve EVER HAD. Recommended. We were hungry, so we tried the food which isn\\'t outrageously priced or terrible, but next time, I\\'ll stick to the drinks. Their mini philly cheese steaks were on bread that was borderline toasted and burned and the hummus plate was standard and boring. The flavor all around the food was lacking and just couldn\\'t compare to what we were getting from the bar. I like the no cell phone policy and the atmosphere, though I\\'d stick to smaller groups since it would be hard to get a seat with a larger crowd and also hard to hear, I\\'d think. The candlelight is both romantic and \\'exclusive\". Our server was great, though she did seem to get a bit overwhelmed as the night went on and we waited longer and longer for drinks, checks, etc. Next time I\\'m looking for some incredible cocktails that are worth every cent of the price ($12), I\\'m headed to Violet Hour.',\n",

       "  \"Ever since dining at San Soo Gab San a couple months ago, I will periodically find myself chanting its name in my head as I walk down the road in stride with my steps, it has a very metronomic quality to it. I still don't know why I do that, but that is a side point. The food at SSGS is an experience to say the least. We only ventured to try the grill-it-yourself meat items (ribeye, chicken, octopus) which were all very good, but I wish they would give some guidance on how long to cook certain items. The Ribeye was hands down the best item on the menu for the following reasons: 1. The meat is tender 2. It is flavorful, even if you overcook it 3. They give you a pair of giant kitchen shears to cut it with. The side dishes are what make the dining experience so memorable. My limited experiences at other Korean BBQ places leads me to believe that the number of side dishes they give you at SSGS is extraordinary (must have been at least 30). They weren't all delicious, but it was great to try all those different items, and could potentially be meal on their own. I liked the service simply because of its ballsiness and attitude.  Ballsiness: when the bus boys bring your grill to the table, they put you at risk of 3rd degree burns at least 3 times between walking to the table and setting the grill in its holder, which is sweet. Attitude: at least a few of the waitresses are super sassy and will gladly make fun of you. Kind of like a korean ed debevic's. Its worth the trip if only to experience it once.\",\n",

I assume that it changes all the time which is great. We started off with some smaller dishes to share. We tried the Roasted Market Squash with hazelnuts and raisins which was awesome. The Spicy Calamari was great as well but I didn't expect it to come out grilled (still fine). For my dinner I ordered the Market Winter Squash Ravioli with brown butter, sage and parmigiano. I LOVED IT. Keep in mind that with the pastas, there are two sizes. The smaller portion is pretty small, so you would certainly want to either get something else or get the larger size. I had a side of the garden salad which was served with a mustard vinaigrette, but I think the server went overboard with the ground pepper! Aye. We like to try a little bit of each others food, I tried some of the Lamb Chops which were nice a juicy. I'm not Venison person, but someone at the table did have it and said it was fantastic. Dessert of course is something that can never be missed. I decided to just order everything they had listed so we could try it all. Some of my favorites were the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart with vanilla bean whipped cream...it was heaven. The Lemon Panna Cotta was also great as well as the Pumpkin Cake with Pistachios and sweet cream. Overall, the atmosphere, service and food was very impressive. I just wish it wasn't so far North from me. I will have to make the trip back for sure. It's a nice place to take friends and family.\",\n",

Wayyyyyy too much half cooked dough and cheese going on. Yuck. I ate this the eve of the Shamrock Shuffle 2012 (smart move...not) and the next morning at the run I felt I was going to have to be sidelined from the stomach pains brought on by this rich and over the top stuffed pizza. I am sure if you are a fan of the deep dish you will find this to be just wonderful.\",\n",

I can see why friends of mine enjoyed it in the past, but wouldn\\'t say it\\'s top notch as far as South Loop breakfasts go. The range of the menu is pretty astounding. You can get everything from huge omelettes that come packed with pretty yummy fillings and sides of pancakes, to baked eggs and crepes. The portions are pretty huge. My friend and I were seated at the front of the restaurant right next to the window, which was nice! The rest of the restaurant was incredibly crowded and a tad claustrophobic, so I was glad we snagged a window seat. Nice view out onto Michigan Avenue/Roosevelt. I got the \"When in Rome\" omelette ($9.99) which was stuffed with Italian sausage, spinach (I think? maybe it was basil), tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese, and topped with marinara sauce. I\\'d never seen an omelette like this on a menu before, and overall I\\'m pretty glad I got it. I got fresh fruit (mostly grapes and pineapple) and an English muffin as my sides. The English muffin was toasted, but already cold, so my butter didn\\'t really melt on it which was too bad. My friend got the nutella crepes. They were pretty delicious and came loaded with strawberries and bananas on top. Overall I\\'d say that Yolk delivers a solid breakfast, and that it\\'s a good place for hungry tourists. But the food isn\\'t really that creatively presented (and I\\'m not sure it\\'s trying to be). So perhaps Yolk\\'s mission is to deliver solid food in huge portions, and in that respect they succeed. I prefer brunches with a little more flair, so I will probably stick to Bongo Room and Eleven City Diner around the corner on Wabash.',\n",

I had two dogs, one dragged through the garden and one with just mustard in onions, the sausage was just too intense for my hangover, and frankly there were like 14 of them on our table and about 8 got eaten.... The dogs were good, great even, two hour wait? I think that there at least a half dozen other hot dog joints in town that I would have enjoyed as much without the wait.

I had been so excited to go there, mostly because places with their own breweries are generally cool. But also, I love pizza, like most humans. We gave it a try around 8pm on a Thursday night, which was a terrible idea since it was packed beyond belief.  The good: The beer was pretty good. I forgot the name of what I had - something about curves - and it was a darker beer but not too bitter or heavy.  The bad: the noise and customers. Close your eyes and picture a trendy, young popular place and you get Piece. For some people these are good things - and that's great for them - but for me, I prefer a quieter, more laid back kind of atmosphere with less pretentiousness hanging out. It was just a little much. The neutral: the pizza. Although intrigued by toppings such as clams and mashed potatoes, the banana pepper pizza we ordered was far from extraordinary. The crust was extremely dry and bland, and since crust is my favorite part, I was understandably disappointed. I must point out that most people wrote the pizza to be great in their reviews, so I guess there is a taste for this kind of slice, but being the pizza snob that I am, I was not at all impressed. all in all, i wouldn't go out of my way, and probably won't be heading back to Piece anytime soon.\",\n",

When the maitre d got to us (with his little clip board), I told him a party of 4. He informed us that the only seats were outside. This was a very muggy 89 degree day - so I asked when an inside seat would be available. He said 2.5 hours later. I grudgingly agreed to sit outside. After we sat down, a each member of my party went to see if indeed all tables were taken. They were not. And people who were not in front of us got seats. If they have a true no reservation dinner policy, that is what it should be. To add insult, the maitre d was very rude (I asked why there were seats inside that were open, he gave the same smart #@@ed toned response regarding 2.5 hours to get a seat inside), and the waiter was even worse. I asked him if they did anything special for birthdays (not singing, but a candle in a dessert) and he gave a very abrupt no.

       "  'I love this place. If you have some extra cash, go there. I have used the catering dept. many times and have been so pleased. They actually found two waiters that spoke German for our clients for a party we had on the red witch. Amazing. Jennfer Moser in Catering is a huge help. Always handy with tips and suggestions. The food is amazing, and i have to say two guilty pleasures are the sticky buns and the chocolate mousse. Oh my god........I have not purchased the meat yet, a little out of my price range, but sometime soon. Try the seafood platter if you can! so good or the artisian platter. killer. Try the cheese department. OH my god! I bought the Black truffle cheese and i nearly died. Be really open to try new things when you go. I bought over$50 worth of cheese and I picked up a new tip for my popcorn. I am so addicted to black truffles, we all know this about me, the gent behind the cheese counter told me he tosses his popcorn in truffle oil!!!!!!!!!!!!! COME ON!!!!!!! and i have to say he not only got the sale of the truffle oil with me i am a groupie now. its so good......... i have tried the meat dept and wow. the choice ribeye. so yummy and tender. you cant go wrong. i have to say though and give this story to you. i had bought NY strip steak for a recipe. i didnt unwrap it till two days later for a party. i was making this crazy recipe where you take the meat and rub it with salt for 40 min. it drains all the water out. well when i opened it up it was completely bad. i was in shock. i had less than 3 hours before my guests arrived. i call fox and told the store manager what happened. i was expecting a bad attitude which didnt happen and i say i gave some which i regret. i wasnt rude but very panicked and upset. she said she would send me more meat via delivery! i was so happy. so happens the delviery guy was one of our waiters from our corp party! i was so happy to see him! i showed him the meat and he was horrified. and i offered it back to him. he took it and threw it out for me, and for that i say thank you. i get the bag and not only was their new meat their was a note saying sorry and the most amazing cheesecake as a gift for my guests. now thats service. things happen, but you can expect fox will always take care of you. which is why now i go once a week after this and buy my meat there and some of my groceries. you cant go wrong.',\n",

       "  \"Truly, I would give Sprout 4.5 stars. I just went for a birthday dinner date on Saturday and had a fantastic experience! The atmosphere is romantic, modern, simple, warmly-lit, and most of all, completely unpretentious. And that's the theme running through this restaurant. It's chic. It's beautiful. But the food does the talking. You may show up in a nice jeans outfit, or you may go all out in dressy attire. No one need feel they must dress to the nines. That is by no means to say that it is easy on the wallet or not an upscale establishment. The pricing is going to run about $100 per person by the end of the evening (if you go for the 3 course prix fixe, have drinks, plus tip). You may order items a la carte, but I feel that if you're going to visit Sprout, you may as well do it up and enjoy your experience to the fullest. Do the prix fixe! The menu is playful and has many choices. You basically choose the headliner protein listed and then the 3 or 4 flavors that compose each dish are listed underneath. You may certainly ask your server what EXACTLY you will be receiving if you feel you need to, but to me there is something fun and exciting about letting a great chef do their job and me experiencing new things. That's what fine dining is all about. For instance, the first course I ordered was the scallop. I haven't had a scallop in years, due to a bad experience a while back. But I thought I'd take the plunge, because if there were ever a time to try them again--it's now. And I did. And that scallop dish was A-mazing. Perfect. Loved it. For the second course I had the steak, and the third, I had a strawberry rhubarb dessert. You will also receive 2 intermezzo courses as well. We were given a wonderful little cup of potato leek soup and delicious grilled cheese with granny smith apple. Almost everything was outstanding, creative, and most of all--tasted fantastic. The only thing I wasn't wowed by was my rhubarb dessert. It was served on a little waffle (which sounds great), but just ended-up a soggy mess. Other than that--wonderful meal. The servers are attentive, but not overwhelmingly so. This is truly a great restaurant. Give it a try!\",\n",

Normally I like that in smaller degrees, but I also like to know that I'm actually eating raw fish. I'm weird like that when I come to sushi. The gomae, additionally, was just eh.

I eat sushi 4 times a week for lunch, so I asked my waiter to do better. He pointed me to chicken. Again, I asked him to do better. He came back from the kitchen and said that he could do a spinach salad, a mushroom and asparagus appetizer and the shaking beef all gluten free. So I took him up on the app and the beef dish. They were fabulous. He came back 15 minutes later with the duck dish that everyone else ordered and was able to make it gluten free too, which was really nice of him to go out of his way to make that happen. My gluten free shaking beef was so good that the group ordered another! Anyhow, great staff (after my initial sushi and chicken issue), fantastic food, great drinks. Oh - and I had a really good avocado dessert of all things. The only downside - no umbrellas. Although apparently the mai tais come in head-shaped glasses. That counts for something.',\n",

       "  \"rick bayless' homage to mexican food is probably the best tasting of mexican food i've had. everything from the attention to detail in the food to the detail in the dining room made us feel like we were having some good food at a cool restaurant in puerto vallarta. yes, the wait is long but this is noted on their site and we came w/ that expectation. for those of you not willing to wait, the bar is full service and you can get food from either frontera grill or topolo next door. we put our names down and waited for a bar seat but were surprised when they sat us earlier than the quoted 1 hour wait. the dining area is lively w/ mexican music playing in the background. once seated, our waitress graciously greeted us and immediately helped us out w/ the drink menu. i got the topolo margarita and wifey got a raspberry tea margarita like drink. we both really loved our drinks. for apps we got the topolo tortilla soup and the queso fundido clasico. the tortilla soup was thinner than i expected it to be but the flavors were pot on. the thin strips of tortilla and chicken all worked together and a douse of lime juice provided a nice hit of acid. the queso fundido was very flavorful. we were given little tortillas so that we can make mini tacos. on the side we were given some chorizo along w/ 2 types of roasted salsas. i tried various combinations of queso, chorizo and salsas and everything was lovely. for mains, i got the enchiladas de mole poblano and she got the tostada de frijoles negros w/ chicken added. the mole sauce in my dish was the best mole sauce i've ever tasted. it was spicy, sweet, rich and complex. the tortilla was perfect and the chicken was very well seasoned and cooked. i'd go back here just for this dish. the tostadas were very light and the cheese on them was so fresh and light. for dessert we got the chocolate-raspberry tart w/ fresh raspberry ice cream. this was a recommendation from the nice group who were seated next to us and had been coming to frontera grill for 23 years! the tart crust was nice but the filling was spectacular w/ both the richness and sweet/tartness of the raspberries working wildly together. the ice cream provided the nice light contrast to the tart and we were left with large smile on our face. i have to mention our waitress again. unfortunately i don't remember her name but she made our meal entertaining and provided great insight into the menu. i was struggling between choosing between the enchilada dish i picked and a halibut dish. in order to help me out she wanted to see if i liked the mole sauce so she brought me a sample of the mole sauce to aid in my decision. everything about this meal just worked so well. if we were living in chicago i'd say we'd be regulars here but all we can hope for is a sister restaurant out here.\",\n",

We started with the guacamole and it was delicious - some of the best I have ever had. I had the steak taco dinner. The corn tortillas that these were served on were incredible.

We found parking, were seated at a booth by the bar. BTW, there were 3 people sitting at the bar, 2 in the booth behind us and ourselves, for a grand total of 7 people. I observed that there were 2 waitresses working with the napkins/ silverware in a table in the back.The busboy brought us our water and the delicious bread plate. We ate bread and drank water. 10 minutes go by, we eat more bread and more water. 15 minutes pass we ran out of bread and drank sips of water. After 20 minutes, we are out of bread and water and no one has come to take our order. Mind you, there are 7 people in the place. A third waitress arrives, apparently to start her shift, and joins the other two in folding napkins.My friend and I got up to leave. As we pass by the hostess station, we find 2 hostess' and the manager. We told them that we were leaving because no one bothered to take our order after 25 minutes of being seated. They looked at each other, looked back at us, and then back at each other again. We walked out .The manager didn't even offer an apology, a free drink or appetizer, NOTHING!!Sad to say, but you have lost 2 customers for life. Apparently you have gotten too big for your britches! BTW, every time we used to go to Calo, we spent big money between drinks and dinner.We ended up going to Rockwell's Neighborhood Grill ( in the area of Rockwell and Leland) where we were warmly greeted, promptly served, ate a great satisfying meal and paid much less than at Calo.\",\n",

However, several minutes went by and no on greeted us, we already decided what we wanted during the time we had to wait and we were starving! I had to get up and go to the host stand where she was chatting away with the server and asked if we could get our order taken. Instead of apologizing for the wait, she said \"well, we like to give people a minute to get situated\"...I sharply replied \"I had 30 minutes to get situated, I\\'m ready NOW.\" and walked away. I\\'m here to enjoy my experience and to be served, not to wait forever for these people to get their restaurant together. When our server came by, she was very nice and got the food out quickly. The coconut shrimp was delicious, flavorful and perfectly cooked. We also ordered the pistachio crusted chicken, grilled flank steak and honey jalapeno pork chop. ALL DELICIOUS.

To start with the atmosphere--it was *dark* which I know other reviews have mentioned, and this definitely adds to the romantic feel. There are lots of candles, dim lights, and (of course!) plenty of sternos glowing throughout the restaurant. I will make the remark that the place had a little bit of a funny smell when we walked in--a little seafood-ish, which is not my favorite smell, but as time went on, that was overcome by scents of chocolate, so we definitely got used to the place. My biggest complaint about the atmosphere though is that the tables were all too close together. Both where we were sitting (I felt like I was sitting in on the the date of the couple at the table next to us) and when I had to walk through the maze of the restaurant to the bathroom. I really felt like I was walking through other people's meals--it was a bit crowded. Once we sat down, we were met by our very helpful, very nice waitress who walked us through the entire menu (both food and wine) and really helped us make a decision about what we wanted. My partner and I each did a premiere meal (entree plus cheese fondue plus chocolate fondue for dessert). We also had some trouble deciding on which wine was right for us--the waitress was really helpful and gave us a taste of both wines we were choosing between, and really helped us make a good decision. :-) The starting course--cheese fondue (and salad) was really good. I loved the cheese and they had some fruits and breads to eat it with. It was wonderful. When it was time for our entrees (which included beef, shrimp, chicken, scallops, lobster and a bunch of vegetables), the waitress was very helpful in giving us a quick overview of how long to cook our food, which was very much appreciated. She was also great in giving us a quick overview of the etiquette and safety procedures for not burning ourselves. She was very helpful. Once we started eating, it was all amazing. The portions seem a little small, but by the time we finished eating, I was stuffed! All of the food was great. I did end up leaving my phone on the table to check the time periodically to see how long I was cooking everything (the idea of eating undercooked seafood or chicken kind of freaks me out...). All the food was great though--the food also comes with 8 dipping sauces. Some of them were great--there was a red chili sauce that tasted great with everything (especially the shrimp) and they had a Geja's sauce that was spicy and delicious. A dill sauce that tasted great on the veggies, and a BBQ sauce that was perfect for the chicken. Basically, everything was great. The dessert course was marvelous--they bring out the chocolate and flambe it for you at the table so that you can roast a marshmallow to start the course--it was adorable! The chocolate was amazing, but by the time it came out I was so stuffed from the entree that I could barely eat, but of course I had to force myself to eat some chocolate! Overall, this was a wonderful experience. It was definitely pricey (and looking over the wine list especially, I was worried about a little bit of price inflation--this is pretty standard at most places, but some of the bottles of wine were a bit overly pricey...). Although it's not a cheap meal, it was definitely worth it. It made for a special night with a meal that was a bit different. My partner and I really enjoyed ourselves. I am very happy we went--it will probably be awhile until we go back, but definitely an experience I will have to try again. Fondue is a fun experience, and though we've done it at home, it made for a great night at Geja's!\",\n",

It was just like every good beet salad I had ever tasted (although the whipped chevre was a very interesting touch). My companion started with the risotto with cheez-its (and she loved it). Second course was the skate (this was truly the thickest piece of skate I had ever seen, having been used to those flaky non existent thin portions you get in french restaurants) for me. Second course for the friend was the stroganoff (which again, she adored).  We shared the peach cobbler (like another reviewer said it was entirely forgettable (I even advised the server of this)).

We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes, which is a long time but hey, good for them for being so packed! We waited in the waiting area and asked the host if he could chill our champaign - he curtly told us we would get a chiller when we sat at our table....ok fine. So with the long wait, and since we couldn't have our bottle chilled, we decided to open it and have a drink while we waited (we all know what happens when a cold bottle of bubbly warms up and then you open it - wanted to avoid that!). My husband asked the same tall, curly haired host if we could get 2 wine or champaign glasses, he gave us 2 warm water glasses. Not a big deal, but we were drinking some pretty good bubbly and I wanted something with a stem. So I asked him for 2 wine glasses, his response: you'll get them when you sit down. Yes, I know - but we're drinking it now, and will bring it with us when we sit down. He rolled his eyes, huffed and said to hold on while he gets them. Excuse me?? I am not being demanding here. He was a pretentious jerk who didn't seem to like his job in the least. On the bright side, we only had to wait about 15 minutes before we were sat. Out waitress was very friendly and helpful, and we ordered a bunch of rolls that we remembered we loved. Now I said before that I haven't been to Coast in a long time, and when we started eating our food I remembered why. Coast maki is the kind of maki that beginners like, or people that don't really like fish like. It's the kind of maki that's drenched in fried tempura and mayo sauces that while it is quite tasty, you cannot taste the fish (except for the Creamy roll - yum). In addition, the portions are so small that we were left hungry (after ordering a lot). For example, the White Dragon that was always my favorite roll - it's basically a roll covered in tempura with eel and mayo sauce on it - well that's all I tasted, if I didn't see the ingredients on the menu I would have no idea what was actually inside of it - and for $14 (I think) it was the exact same size as the regular rolls. Perhaps my tastes matured? Maybe I've had truly good sushi too many times to think that Coast food is actually good (compare Coasts White Dragon to Oysy's White Dragon and you'll see what I mean)? I don't know, but while I liked it (heck, I like fast food sometimes too) it was not what I consider to be maki. So, while the dÃ©cor is absolutely lovely and the byob aspect is great, I will probably not return to Coast as I know what good sushi is and it's not at Coast.\",\n",

Japan is known for having these sweet little dimly lit minimalist eateries that make you feel like you are a celebrity when you sit down serving up the most tasty little plates and delicacies. WRONG. Don\\'t let the ambiance of Coast in Bucktown fool you...that is unless you are okay with the worst excuse for Japanese food you could buy. Having eaten in Japan for 2 years, my husband and I feel we have a pretty good eye and palate for what should and should not be served in a Japanese restaurant. The maki sushi was tasteless. When having the salmon, crab and then the tuna there was absolutely no difference between them. Yes, the shoyu has a tendency to override the experience but there is a subtle quality to raw fish that is different from species to species. Was it really fish? Maybe not because it did not come with the Japanese accompaniment of fresh grated daikon, which is used to aid in the digestion of the fat and cleanse the palate. The rice layer was so thin, and even though there are different kinds of rolls, some calling for a lot of filling that makes you wonder how you will fit it in your mouth (futomaki), just straight up hosomaki had us wondering where the rest was. I guess we were just spoiled in Japan having these huge bites to contend with even when it was just plain hosomaki sushi. You\\'d look around while you\\'re eating and see everyone with full cheeks. Seriously, the bento sushi at Whole Foods is better than what they are serving up at Coast, and most of those employees seem to be Korean. Who is making the sushi at Coast, really?  The miso soup had one tiny piece of tofu in it. Was this an insult or were they totally serious? Probably the biggest disappointment was the tempura. The batter should be bubbly and well coat the piece, made of a mix of flour, egg and water. Unless it is fried and served on a stick (kushiage), it should not be breaded or crumbly. The tempura at Coast is breaded and not the traditional yummy tempura batter that is lumpy and thick. Once you\\'ve had real tempura, this version is such a disappointment because there are small plates that this type of breading is called for, they are radically different and should be labeled as such. Also, the dipping sauce did not come again with the grated daikon, bummer. Our waiter seemed absolutely clueless as well when asked if we could get some. Daikon not at a Japanese restaurant...I\\'m confused. Lastly, and this isn\\'t just Coast, but in Japan edamame is served as a snack with alcohol much like peanuts are here. As an appetizer, edamame would have any foreign traveler from Japan politely smiling but inside saying, \"What have these American\\'s done, this should not be served alongside gyoza, this is beer food!\". If you have any suggestions on where to get some good sushi and real tempura, let us know. Tried Bob-san and Coast and with having been embarrassed bringing out of town Japanese guests to one and exploring the other on our own, anyone who knows what I\\'m talking about give me a holla on where to go.  -SS',\n",

I hate that in Chicago, I have to drive across town to find a Vietnamese restaurant to get some good authentic food, but this place is good. They are fast and it is cheap. They are pretty friendly too. I only gave them four stars because their sanitary condition may be a little questionable. Of course we did go for a Saturday night dinner at 8pm and they were totally packed, but their floors were nasty with food an trash everywhere, I just tried not to think about the kitchen because I was craving some authentic Vietnamese food and had not had any in five months. I will be back and I love that they have such a wide array of items on their menu.',\n",

       "  'My dad had an appointment to talk with a doctor at Resurrection Hospital on Chicago\\'s far northwest side. Resurrection is undergoing some parkway construction on its property off Talcott Ave. I would rather not drive there anyway. Dad qualifies for the free ride for senior citizens on metropolitan transit systems, and I have a Chicago Card and a clutch of one- & two-day CTA transit passes. Unfortunately for us, dad didn\\'t check to see that the doctor with whom he needed to speak would be there when we arrived at Resurrection. (This isn\\'t medical related. Dad believes that this doctor mis-filed a form to the Railroad Retirement Board. RRB rejected that claim, and Resurrection is expecting payment directly from him.) We got there at 3:10 pm, and learned that this doctor had opted to leave early on Friday. {Should I mention that a north side b**eball franchise had a home game this day? I guess a doctor can afford to buy a ticket to it.} So we were out of there quite rapidly. We went back to the stop for the #88 Higgins bus and dad asked, \"Where do you want to go eat?\" The bell rang in my head. Hot dog stands have been getting a lot of press lately, and there was one somewhat nearby to which we could get because it was the correct time of day. Superdawg at Milwaukee, Devon, & Nagle. The #88 bus loops unidirectionally (clockwise) from Harlem & Talcott Aves. via Talcott, Canfield, and Devon. We had to transfer at a point on Devon Ave. which gets rush-hours-only service from the #56A North Milwaukee route [c.v.]. We arrived at Superdawg. The line was six deep. That gave us enough time to deduce what we would order. We both opted for the SuperdawgÂ®. I feel pangs of turmoil having to scribe this. I, and my dad as well, felt the hot dog (complete with french fries, $4.75) was not as good as some others we have had. It is an eight, but the additional meat didn\\'t seem to have the distinctive snap and bite which I expect from any size hot dog. (I again cannot discern whose hot dog is being served. It is not Vienna Beef, and I believe it is not Red Hot Chicago. Maybe it is Slotkowski\\'s?) I had all the standard toppings, and dad also had the hot peppers. Have you noticed the prices for the italian beef sandwiches in my prior reviews? I am sorry; but this is *not* a good value for the money. I surmise I\\'ll have to attribute the high-rankings of this venue to the \"carnival atmosphere\". It has been around since 1948. Its mascots on the roof have appeared in scores of photographs, television programs, & movies aiming to set themselves in Chicago. If you enjoy carnivals, you will enjoy browsing around here. But the corollary message being conveyed here is that the hot dog is _the sideshow_. Transit options: This seems incongruous. Superdawg is keenly identified as a \\'drive-in\\' stand. The concept of eating outside your vehicle could be considered bizarre. But noting what I scribed in the above review, you might want to save some money by not motoring here. As it is, for being on the far northwest side of Chicago, nearly in Niles, this has multiple bus routes which can get you here. But some of them do not run on weekends, and one way here is only possible during weekday rush hours. The most frequently-running bus route here is the CTA #56A North Milwaukee bus. (Prior to 1970, extending back to the streetcar era, the Milwaukee route ran through from downtown to the forest preserve loop at Milwaukee & Imlay.) You catch this route at the Blue Line \"L\"\\'s or Metra Union Pacific northwest line\\'s Jefferson Park station. The #56A has an auxiliary. Pace bus route #270 also runs from Jefferson Park on Milwaukee Ave. Its service goes on to the Golf Mill Mall. If you are at Jefferson Park, these two routes are [now] in adjacent lanes in the south bay of the station. (In the late 1970s, when through-transferring was finally authorized between CTA and suburban Regional Transportation Authority bus routes, the #56A was in the north bay and the #270 was in the south bay. You needed both routes\\' print schedules to determine which bus left next. [The #270 schedule was bi-lingual: English and _Polish_.]) The #270 makes limited stops within the City of Chicago. Devon Ave. is one of its stops. The combined schedule of the two routes have the last bus going south to Jefferson Park until 11:00 pm on weekdays and Saturdays, and 10:45 pm on Sundays. The operation which my dad and I caught to get there from Resurrection Hospital leaves from Devon, Avondale, and Odell streets (west of the railroad tracks) from 3:30 pm to 6:55 pm on weekdays only. Another route which terminates at Milwaukee & Imlay is the #86 Narragansett | Ridgeland route. It runs weekdays only on Nagle & Narragansett streets to the Green Line \"L\"\\'s Ridgeland station in Oak Park. After 6:00 pm, it is on a 30-minute headway until 9:30 pm. Both CTA routes are on the _Bus Tracker_ system.',\n",

We made the mistake of not doing so and waited over 2 hours to be seated, on a Thursday!

       "  'I used to love this place, they had such great pizza. Just like Jeff G. mentioned this place is over- rated. Unlike many reviewers, I live in the area. I ordered pizza from this place since 2004. The quality of this restaurant has been declining steadily. I\\'m not sure if people have lowered their standards of good food but believe me when I tell you that they do not serve good food in this restaurant. Their pizza has gone from great to mediocre (when ur drunk). I also had the opportunity to visit the dining room. The experience was unforgettable.... as in I\\'m never going there again. I invited my family to this restaurant. Waitstaff was rude,it took them about 45 minutes to take my order and the dining room was empty, waitstaff was clueless, and the food arrived cold and tasteless. It\\'s a shame I had to pay for that kind of service especially when in this economy people are very selective about how and where they spend their money. People, seriously, don\\'t believe everything you see in \"Check Please\". Any dumba** can call themselves a foodie. I regret following their advice when they recommended visiting \"Cemitas\" located on North Ave. during the weekend. They had a 17 year old kid making the food. We got charged $8 for a sorry excuse of a sandwich. Anyway back to La Villa, if you want real Italian pizza go to Spacca Napoli pizzeria on 1769 W. Sunnyside or if you want real Italian fare like sandwiches and homemade pasta (yes, grandma makes it fresh daily) go to Tony\\'s Italian Deli on 6708 N. Northwest Hwy. Now that\\'s real Italian.',\n",

Well Lent ended a while ago, but we finally had an excuse to be in Glenn's 'hood, so we gave it a whirl. Verdict: why oh why did we wait so long to get up here! Lent or not, Glenn's is awesome. It is, in fact, mostly seafood, but instead of doing seafood in a fancy, haughty way, they just make it taste awesome. It really feels like a diner, but an uber popular one. Without reservations on a Wednesday evening we were relegated to the bar. But with the super friendly, honest and helpful bartenders, it was hardly a set back. Don't be intimidated by the huge menu they give you. Toss it aside and focus on the chalkboards on the wall - that's where the good stuff is. Fish of every make and model, in a huge variety of preparations, plus apps and desserts that looked amazing. We went with the shrimp in butter and cheese and goodness for an appetizer, then the jambalaya and the arctic char for dinner. All SO good.

Our first meal was probably closer to 3.5 stars. Great pork chop and pretty good burger. Our second meal was closer to a 2 star. Some significantly undercooked mussels that we couldn't finish was the bummer of the night. The flank steak appetizer with watermelon and goat cheese was an interesting mix of sweet and savory, and the rest of the meal was simply average. In terms of the food overall - this place is not going to knock your socks off by inspirational cuisine; after all it is a gastropub. But if you stick to items that sound like dressed up pub food you probably won't be disappointed. It will be a decent meal, but nothing that will be a future must-have that requires a return visit. Also consider the price - this is fine dining prices for upscale bar food. Service is attentive, and in some cases they seem to be almost trying TOO hard. But they mean well, are very attentive and friendly, and do their best to accommodate the patrons. For example, our bad batch of mussels were taken off the check without question or hesitation. And we didn't expect them to do it. We've only dined here on weekend nights, so can't attest to the power lunches. But there was a fair amount of tourist traffic. That said it doesn't feel like a tourist trap (e.g., Planet Hollywood, etc.) and you don't notice it unless you are looking for it. Overall - solid. If you have out of town guests and you're doing the Millennium/Grant Park tour, this would be a great spot for an impromptu visit, assuming you've indulged in the requisite Italian beef and/or deep dish. Not a value buy, but a good alternative if you happen to be in the neighborhood (in other words, don't go out of your way).\",\n",

International Finance Manager). I was there a friday night and i asked one of the twins about their schedule for sunday and I WAS TOLD from noon to something, since i've just been in that place over 10 times but on week days and saturday night, i didn't really know. Anyway, i went there with all these important people (they were in Chicago just for few hours) and unfort. CALO was CLOSED!!! was amazing!! how come that happened? no idea, just they gave me the wrong information something that was so embarrassed !! So i ended up in the restaurant next door where the food is sooooooooo bad!!I called to the manager and let him know what happened, he said sorry but that was it! nothing else, nothing like a note card or a call back to let me know that he talked with that person (as feedback), NOTHING!!I still go to that place sometimes but of course i don't send any of my friends and of course i don't bring my business dinner either and i make sure my company and my employees don't do that anymore!!!Where is the MANAGEMENT? they should've trained their employees better!! And if you want to go to details, make sure your people (hostess or waiters) are around the door so they can welcome the person!Great food but unfort. need grow up in the management and trainning service!!A little advice for PEOPLE! Please DO NOT ever go there if you know something, and if you need any type of INFORMATION please SEE the Manager on DUTY and ask for it!!ADVICE for MANAGEMENT! Make sure your employees meet the standars and policies of your property, if not that would cost you money! 80 dollars i had spent on my business meetings or with friends each time, plus a lunch that you lost (around 1200 dollars) because you gave the wrong information??

       "  'Ultimately, I wouldn\\'t travel up to the 5300 block of Clark Street in order to eat here, but if I were up there and looking for a good bite, I would probably go back. My biggest issues were with service and the pasta dishes, but otherwise the food was pretty good. Careful with dishes that include chili oil - they\\'re not fooling around when it comes to adding heat. Here\\'s how it went down: Right off the bat, we ordered a bottle of sparkling rose to celebrate one of my best friends\\' birthdays. At the same time, we ordered the assortment of the first eight starters on the menu as well as a special starter and a salad: grilled scamorza cheese with chili oil and lemon and the market salad with fresh sugar snap peas, fava beans and shaved pecorino in a light lemon and herb dressing. The assortment was wonderful: red beets, white turnips, cannellini beans, asparagus, farro, eggplant caponata, roasted peppers with a breadcrumb topping and olives. We ate just about the whole plate between the three of us. The scamorza cheese was VERY spicy and delicious, but had a fried-looking coating which was inconsistent with the \"grilled\" description. The spice kind of took over and didn\\'t leave room for the other flavors, but that didn\\'t kill the dish for me. The market salad was excellent - very light and fresh and crisp. That was gone in under 3 minutes. We\\'d pretty much finished all of our starters (and, as you can see, we ordered a lot of them) when we realized that we didn\\'t have our rose. Or the basket of bread that everyone around us seemed to have. Or a new bottle of water (which was pretty important since the cheese was so hot). When our waiter finally came back, we very nicely reminded him of the rose and he was quick to admit that he had completely forgotten it. He was racing back to the kitchen before we could also ask for the bread and water. He finally got us the wine and raced around for the bread and water as soon as we asked. We figured that even though he was a little forgetful, he was trying to make up for it. Plus, from the moment we came into the restaurant he had been fluttering around our table complimenting us and \"flirting\" as much as a middle-aged gay man can with three twenty-somethings. I figured it was in the hope of getting a better tip. Anyway, after the wine, bread and water incident, he mentioned in an apologetic way that he would make it up to us and to make sure the birthday girl left room for dessert. In my head, I figured \"free dessert\" or at least free something. Our entrees arrived and they initially brought me the wrong pasta. I took a look at it and quickly explained that this didn\\'t look like the strozzapretti the waiter had described - he had said \"bowtie pasta\" and this was penne of some kind. They very quickly made the switch, so I wasn\\'t really put off by the mixup. But when they set my correct dish in front of me, I was confused by what the waiter thought a bowtie looked like. The pasta was clearly homemade, which I appreciated, but it was just thick, dense strips of dough - not light and al dente. The seasonings were good - spicy from the chilis and pretty fishy due to the anchovy soffritto, but the pasta itself was just not well made. Period. The other pasta at our table was the orrechiette with lamb sausage. The pasta actually looked like orrechiette, so that was good, but when I tasted it, I was similarly disappointed. Too dense and doughy - not al dente at all (at least I didn\\'t think it was - the orderer of the dish didn\\'t seem to mind). The flavors in the orrechiete were, again good, but still lacking a little. I wanted there to be more sauce. As it was, the pasta was a little too dry for me. It was really too bad about both pasta dishes because I go to Italian places for the purpose of ordering pasta and I want it to be excellent every time. However, I think Anteprima is a place for traditional main courses because the birthday girl\\'s hangar steak was to die for. The steak itself was grilled rare with excellent, crusty seasonings and sat on a bed of farro with a mint and fava bean pesto. The pesto was excellent and tasted really light and fresh. With the farro and juicy steak, the dish was incredible. I don\\'t order steak very much because I generally figure I know what the flavor of a steak is and want to try something new, but I would probably order the hangar steak if I went back - the flavors were very original. I was impressed. We didn\\'t do a dessert (we walked down the block to share a sundae at George\\'s instead - the Grasshopper is spectacular), but the list provided a lot of variety and involved a lot of fresh fruit, which I appreciated. The bill came promptly and to my surprise there was no comped anything and no secret birthday dessert. This didn\\'t really bother me, but it didn\\'t improve my overall sentiments about the lacking service.',\n",

The decor is modern, sleek, and swanky and what is also really nice is that you get a glimpse of what's going on in the kitchen since it is on display.  The food is fantastic. Never have I been to place where each taste you are tasting is painstakingly calculated and intentional. I had the perfectly cooked Australian Sea Bass that melted on my tongue. The portions aren't that huge, but I almost feel that it is on purpose so that you savor every rationed bite. I was satisfied with just that...but then the desert menu came. Once upon a time there was a wonderful dish called S'Mores. Smores have always consistently delivered. Then one day, Smores' cousin came into town, who happened to be a better looking, better tasting, a more sophisticated supermodel of smores. That's what the croquettes are at Mercat! These delicious supermodels had a crunch and that chocolate oozing out of the middle, sitting in a puddle of aioli. I could've had 50 of them.  Overall, my experience at Mercat was one of the most pleasant I've ever had. **It is also nestled in the Blackstone Hotel (which is gorgeous!)  Another added bonus to this beautiful restaurant is the wonderful staff. I politely asked them if we could shoot our engagement photos there while the restaurant was closed, and they were more than happy to accommodate this unusual request.\",\n",

       "  \"Go to Chicago, eat deep-dish, hot beef and get a hot dog. Where should we go? Well, everyone goes to Hot Doug's because they are the best around. In fact, you'll have to wait in line for 2 and a half hours to experience the very best, and let me tell you, it's worth it.That's what I thought, before I went to Hot Doug's. After waiting in line, eating the dogs, I wasn't thrilled, or hungry, though I was disturbed by the amount of time I wasted in line. Had I experienced the hype?After research I found that yes, the hype which surrounds this establishment is in fact, the experience of eating the hot dog or hot dogs, then having to lie to yourself to reconcile the fact you wasted two plus hours waiting for that which you just ate. Then you lie to other people, to get back at the world, to prolong the lie, to make others feel your pain, so that when you meet those others (and they are out there. Just look at all the liars who posted five star reviews [including me], even Anthony Bourdain had no reservations about lying to America), you both know what you went through. You don't share your story, because no one wants to ever speak of what Hot Doug's actually did to them. Its that look of shame, the bowing of the head, then the smile, knowing that you both continue the lie, every day, telling as many people as you can to go to Hot Doug's, the best hot dog you'll ever eat. Because after having your hot doug experience, the only thing that can help you sleep at night is the joy you take at knowing others will feel more disappointed than you. This monster will never stop. It's not supposed to. From its beginning, Hot Doug's never told the truth. Immediately upon opening there was a line created by the theory that they should serve only the amount of seats in the store. People, walking and in cabs, immediately noticed the line and said whats going on here, there's gotta be some good hot dog's. I trust a store with such a catchy name and a long line. Little did they know how much they were going to suffer. And yet, as these original inquisiters stood in line, more and more stood behind them. Day after day, people began remembering seeing the line, or hearing from bus drivers and cabbies about how good the hot dogs must be at Hot Doug's with a line that long. But it never was the hot dogs, its not about the hot dogs. Its all about the lie. It was always about the lie.So go ahead, read the other reviews, sure you'll see five stars, and others will probably say that I'm lying. But remember, that's what they want you to think. And honestly, they're telling the truth, because no one wants to remember. We, the survivors of hot doug's, don't want this to stop, because we can never get back those two hours, or what the experience of Hot Dougs did to us. The only solace is knowing that you won't believe me, until you take that first bite. But then its too late. And you'll have to tell some other joe off the street, that when they head to Chicago, they need to eat Deep dish, hot beef, and stand in line at Hot Dougs for two hours, because its worth the wait.\",\n",

       "  \"Authentic Greek foods in the heart of Greek community. The foods are good. No surprises. The service people are above average.. very attentive. Instead of ordering individual dishes, 2 of the group order the family style meals instead for $22 a person. Overall it's good with adequate foods to feed for 3 actually. It gives you a sampling of common Greek foods and desserts. They serve regular coffee and Lipton tea at the end... nothing unique about that. They also offer unique Mediterranean dishes. The ambiance and deco are very intimate and cultural. It's clean. So diners, enjoy a traditional Greek meals in a comfortable setting. Adventure a bit if desired.\",\n",

       "  \"As an avid meat eater, I gotta say that Brazzaz impressed me. Not as well known or pretty as Fogo de Chao, but I think just as good. The premise is the same, funny pant wearing waiters carry around massive quantities of meat and serve off of the spit. Something about Brazzaz makes it a little more casual than it's more attractive cousin Fogo.  The meats are just as good, the salad bar can be beefed up a bit more in my opinion, and the sides on the table are almost identical and they do have that great Brazilian soda which compliments the meat very well.  I would say this is more of a special occasion place or a meat eating contest arena, either way you're going to walk out too full for your own good and unbuttoned pants (happened twice).\",\n",

       "  \"I did another round of Duckmas here. What's Duckmas? Well, it's the same day as Christmas, only we celebrate friendship and gluttony, and duck! I was worried after a bunch of rounds of phone tag and telephone with the staff that Duckmas might not happen, but it was all sorted out and ran smoothly on the big day. If you want the Beijing Duck Feast then you MUST call ahead and place an order. Their website says it takes them about 24 hours to prepare, so don't just show up expecting duck to magically appear. Not even on Christmas. They also say that a single duck dinner feeds 4-5 people. We had exactly 12 guests at our giant table and ordered 3 Duck Feasts. It was the perfect amount, but 2 people did not eat duck and ordered something else. We also ordered a couple sides of veggies and extra buns. Sun Wah is still BYOB even though they also have a liquor license and sell drinks. Corkage fee is $5 per bottle of wine. With all the food + corkage each person paid $18 for a ginormous meal. If that's not a Christmas miracle, I don't know what is!\",\n",

       "  \"This is my 1st review on YELP, but I was just so disappointed. After having received dozens of those Neighborhood Coupon things at home, we decided to check this place out. We had a couple of friends in from San Diego to visit us. The best part of the meal was the setting,,it's busy, loud, nice atmosphere, and very comfortable, and we had a window seat on a nice night. That is about it for the pluses. \\xa0The negatives were:1. Hostess was really robotic like, never looked us in the eye, and just did the follow me thing to the table. Our guests asked us is this Chicago or New York City??2. We placed our order with the waitress, average job on her part. In the meantime, me and my friend both ran out of drinks while we waited for her to come back...wait..wait..wait..3. App came..fine..Calamari..not bad..good portion size.4. Meals arrive, the women got large portions of pasta, and we got  \\xa0 \\xa0 small portions of chicken and fish..We said Wow..big portions \\xa0 \\xa0 of the pasta..Waitress says,  Yeah,,we have smaller portions  \\xa0 \\xa0 available.. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 We ladies would have taken the smaller portions in a heart beat \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 if we knew, and they are not on the menu.5. My friend got a Caprese Salad too..like 3 slices of Fresh Mozz and  \\xa0 \\xa0a few slices of Tomatoes, and Olive Oil..Pretty, but way overpriced \\xa0 \\xa0for what you get.6. Meal over, doggie bagged both pastas, and we, the men, still hungry \\xa0 \\xa0 due to our small portions..great..but not yet over.....the busboy guy, \\xa0 \\xa0 broken English at best, didn't understand the \\xa0doggie bag and when \\xa0 \\xa0 the waitress gave us our bill..we asked about the doggie bag, and  \\xa0 \\xa0 after a few minutes, we were told that it was thrown out...7. So....she offered to remake it, and we waited for a remake..8. We ran out of drinks while we waited too...Recap...Service was not good, food was okay, but overpriced forwhat we received. Atmosphere is nice, but you can get that everywhere in this neighborhood...Sorry, we will not be back..\",\n",
