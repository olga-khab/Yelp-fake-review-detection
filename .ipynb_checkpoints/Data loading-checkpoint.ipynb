The place was pretty noisy, so I was disappointed by that. \\xa0We had to yell a bit to talk to each other. \\xa0I do apologize to my fellow diners, I\\'m sure I wasn\\'t talking about anything dinner table appropriate. \\xa0 The interior is absolutely gorgeous and it has a done of seating! \\xa0The downstairs bar area is fantastic for a party. \\xa0I will totally recommend for next year\\'s holiday party!

There seemed to be a language barrier with our server and the busboy, I don\\'t think they could communicate with each other either.

Get him.\" All we wanted was to order more food, which was slightly difficult as well. I feel like I\\'m always hot or cold, never comfortable, here. The dining room is very pretty, it\\'s nice to look at. But my teeth were chattering so loud from the shivering that it was hard to have a conversation. It\\'s summer in Chicago, I was wearing jeans and a silk shirt, there is really no good reason for me to be so cold while eating dinner. The koi swimming around in the little pool next to our table was a nice touch though. The food doesn\\'t quite make up for the service and chillness.

The wine list also is comprehensive. To eat: (served family style so it's easy to try everything) Corn: cream with delicious cream fresh and paprika. Each kernel exposed sweetness in your mouth. Beets with ricotta: the cheese! Sweetest ricotta I've ever had. The beets exceptional too. Suckling pig: I don't order pork ever and this was amazing. Served with kale, oranges and pine nuts this dish is a must. Crunchy but not greasy. Frits with two eggs: pipping hot fries with eggs, who ever thought of such a wonderful idea and why isn't this available everywhere?! Sausage (blanc?): mustard potatoes and cooked grapes. Probably the weakest of the lot but the standards are pretty high. Lavender apple crisp with almond ice cream: Wow. Crispy crumble and moist apple pieces. The ice cream has a thick creamy texture.

I do not use the term vacation dinner lightly - this is truly an experience that will transcend culinary predispositions as well as American Express cards. Defining this dining experience is not something I can jot down in a few hundred words in some online review. \\xa0Rather it is simply the experience of enjoying something that was designed, no destined, to be a work of art. I have eaten from delis, food carts, and extremely fine dining establishments across the United States, this was just distinctly different. My Beautiful Wife - in the awe of interesting meals coming faster than Nordstrom Rack Shoes Clearances, could not stop photographing and commenting on the distinctiveness of each dish. \\xa0However, I sat awestruck - wondering how someone can sit around and think of an experience remotely similar to this culinary journey. We of course had the staples, \\'hot potato - cold potato\\' and the desert that could easily be described as the next act at Blue Man Group. \\xa0But it was the detail, no the attention to detail, that had me wondering. \\xa0Where does Grant get this inspiration? \\xa0When did the thought putting a pillow of pine-scented air on my table with a beautiful bowl enter his mind? The wine was wondrous. \\xa0Please don\\'t indulge without it. \\xa0It should not be an optional component. \\xa0This interface with the meal was critical to my understanding of the dish as well as my propensity of getting \\'more\\' later on in the evening (thanks Grant!)
